Use this sequential four-question approach to determine if the EKG reveals SVT with aberrancy vs ventricular tachycardia

**If you answer YES to any of these questions, it is ventricular tachycardia.**

1.  Is there an ABSENCE of RS complex in all precordial leads (V1-V6?)
2.  Is the R to S interval &gt; 100 msec (2.5 boxes) in one precordial lead?
3.  Is there Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation?
4.  Is there morphology criteria for VT?

## 1. Is there an ABSENCE of RS complex in all precordial leads (V1-V6?)

-   **YES:** VT diagnosis (Sensitivity 21%, Specificity 100%)
-   **NO:** Move to Question 2

## 2. Is the R to S interval &gt; 100 msec (2.5 boxes) in one precordial lead?

-   **YES:** VT diagnosis (Sensitivity 66%, Specificity 98%)
-   **NO:** Move to Question 3

## 3. Is there Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation?

-   **YES:** VT diagnosis (Sensitivity 82%, Specificity 98%)
-   **NO: **Move to Question 4

## 4. Is there morphology criteria for VT?

Determine if you have a LBBB morphology (dominant S wave in V1) or a RBBB morphology (dominant R wave in V1) then use the appropriate section below to help differentiate. Is there morphology criteria for VT?

-   **YES:** VT diagnosis (Sensitivity 98.7%, Specificity 96.5%)
-   **NO:** SVT with aberrance (Sensitivity 96.5%, Specificity 98.7%)

## Dr. Stephen Smith's Expert Review

 Verekei has subsequently published 2 criteria which are much easier to apply and performed better than the Brugada criteria: 

 This one, which is still a bit complex: <http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/5/589.full> 

 AND a second one which uses aVR only: <http://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271%2807%2900943-5/abstract>.

I have a post on differentiating VT and SVT with aberrancy using the Sasaki rule, which has not been validated either, but is even simpler than either Vereckei rule.  I use it as a final step if I don’t have the diagnosis from 6 earlier steps.  Of course, the diagnosis is not nearly as important as the management, which is easily accomplished by electrical cardioversion.
