**Tips:**

-   **2 minutes** of continuous, uninterrupted CPR is key before rechecking the rhythm.
-   Think about giving <span class="drug">epinephrine</span> every **OTHER** time you check the rhythm. This puts it at roughly a q4 minute dosing (recommended q3-5 minutes).
-   Don't delay CPR when you recognize a cardiac arrest. That means do this first, and then work on giving oxygen, placing the patient on various monitors, setting up the defibrillator, and establishing IV/IO access. Hence, the C-A-B mnemonic (Circulation before Airway)
-   Chest compressions should be "hard and fast" -- Depth of at least 2 inches and ≥ 100 compressions with a target pCO2 on the end-tidal capnography of ≥10 mm Hg.
-   Use your mobile phone's timer to help alert you every time when 2 minutes is up.

**Additional reversible causes** (not listed on ACLS AHA guidelines):

-   Hypoglycemia
-   Trauma
