At this trifurcation, assess for compressibility of all three veins.\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jz/1/c/b0c6ad4a-7671-5fad-bd12-36176152e8f0/640.png)Figure 2: Transducer location to evaluate the popliteal vein and normal ultrasound images showing popliteal artery **(A)** and fully compressible vein **(V)**.\n\n## Positive (Abnormal) DVT Study\n\n**A non-compressible vein indicates a positive study for thrombosis.**\n\nNormally, there should be complete coaptation of the venous walls – a.k.a. the walls collapse against one another. If the vein does not full compress, one assumes there is an intraluminal thrombus.\n\nNote: While the thrombus is frequently visualized as a discrete echogenic structure, it may not always be seen.\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jz/1/c/631acfc1-2676-57c2-abef-d020f4d354e8/640.png)Figure 1: Positive DVT study showing **thrombus** in the femoral vein **(v),** adjacent to the femoral artery **(a)** and involving the greater saphenous vein **(s)**. The image on the right demonstrates that the **vein does not collapse with compression**.\n\n## Struggling with the Exam?\n\n**Larger or edematous patients?**\nUse the curvilinear probe if you can’t visualize the deep veins.\n\n**Can’t compress vein, but can’t visualize clot?**\nAssume that there is a DVT, as clots can be isoechoic with the surrounding blood and may not be directly visualized. Direct visualization of the thrombus is not required for a positive study.\n\n**Difficulty finding the popliteal vein?**\nThe popliteal vein can be difficult to identify. Try having the patient hang the legs over the edge of the bed to distend the vessels or position the patient in the prone position while passively flexing the knee with the foot in the air. Color Doppler may also help identify the vessels.\n\n**Not sure if the vein is fully compressing?**\nA normal vein will completely disappear when compressed. Make sure to center the vein on the screen and apply pressure evenly. If pressure is not applied directly perpendicular to the skin, the vessel may appear not to collapse due to unevenly distributed pressure.\n\n**How much pressure is enough?**\nAn appropriate amount of pressure gives complete collapse of the vein as well as some (but not full) compression of the adjacent artery.\n\n## Common Errors:\n\nOther structures, such as lymph nodes, may mimic a thrombus. Be sure to scan through the entire structure as a lymph node will appear discrete and separate from the vessels.\n\nTo fully evaluate the common femoral vein, make sure to visualize the proximal region at the confluence of the greater saphenous and common femoral veins.\n"},"DVT":{"title":"DVT of the Leg - ACCP Guidelines","collection":["cardiovascular","ebm"],"tags":null,"slug":"DVT","content":"\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) of Leg: 2012 ACCP Guidelines\n\n**Wells Clinical Prediction Criteria for DVT (Determine pretest probability)**\n\n|                                                    |     |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----|\n| Active malignancy                                  | +1  |\n| Major surgery within 4 weeks or bedridden &gt; 3 days   | +1  |\n| Asymmetric calf swelling &gt; 3 cm in affected leg | +1  |\n| Collateral, non-varicose superficial veins         | +1  |\n| Entire leg swelling                                | +1  |\n| Localized tenderness along deep venous system      | +1  |\n| Pitting edema greater in symptomatic leg           | +1  |\n| Paralysis, paresis, or recent leg immobilization   | +1  |\n| Previous DVT                                       | +1  |\n| Alternative diagnosis equally or more likely       | -2  |\n\n**Apply Wells score** to the [2012 ACCP Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22315267) as summarized below.\n\n## Wells score &lt; 1 (LOW pretest probability, 5%) \n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jx/5/m/68864aa5-16de-5cd2-8fd1-b50189915f74/640.png)\n\n## Wells Score 1-2 (Moderate pretest probability, 17%)  \n\n***Two options:*** start with D-dimer or ultrasound \n\n***Note:*** If significant comorbidities exist that may cause D-Dimer elevation, start with ultrasound as initial test.

This goes beyond a triage assessment.\nStabilize patients with medical emergencies to reasonably ensure that no deterioration will result from patient's transfer.\nRestrict transfer of non-stabilized patients to 2 circumstances:\n1.  Patient requests a transfer in writing after being informed of the risks involved and the hospital’s duty to treat under EMTALA, or\n2.  A physician certifies that the medical benefits expected from transfer outweigh the risks involved in the transfer (e.g. need higher level of care)\n\n**Pregnancy:** When having contractions, an emergency medical condition exists when:\n-   Inadequate time for safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or\n-   Transfer may pose a threat to the health/safety of patient or unborn child\n\n## Steps when transferring a patient\n\n1.  Provide medical treatment to minimize the risk of transfer\n2.  Obtain patient’s written consent for transfer\n3.  Provide signed certificate of transfer\n4.  Assure that the transfer takes place with qualified personnel and equipment\n5.  Send copies of medical records related to the emergency condition\n\n## Obligation of receiving ED\n\nIf have available space and qualified personnel for treating the patient:\n\n1.  Agree to accept transfer of the patient and to provide appropriate medical tx\n2.  Regional referral centers and hospitals with specialized capabilities cannot refuse to accept an appropriate transfer if they have the capacity\n\n## Fines under EMTALA\n\nA physician can be fined for:\n\n-   Failing to respond to an emergency while on-call\n-   Failing to perform a screening exam\n-   Failing to inform emergency patients of the risks and benefits of transfer\n-   Signing a transfer certification when he or she can reasonably be expected to know that the risks outweigh the benefits\n\nFine = $25,000 or $50,000 per violation (hospital with &lt;100 beds vs ≥100 beds)\n\n## References\n\n-   [EMTALA, acep.org](http://www.acep.org/content.aspx?id=25936)\n-   AMA Ethics Resource Center\n"},"FAST-ultrasound":{"title":"Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST)","collection":["ultrasound","radiology","trauma"],"tags":null,"slug":"FAST-ultrasound","content":"\n\n\n# Ultrasound: Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST)\n\n<span>Durston W et al. </span>*Ann of Surg*<span>, 1998.

Use an overhand grasp on the probe to apply steady downward pressure.\n-   Include views of the entire heart with all 4 chambers and surrounding pericardium\n-   FAST is **POSITIVE** if free fluid is identified between the heart and pericardial sac. \n\n## Struggling with the Exam?\n\n-   **Can’t find the spleen or left kidney?**\n    -   The left kidney is often located more superior and posterior compared to the right kidney. Try placing the probe more posterior towards the left flank.\n\n-   **Can’t find the bladder?**\n    -   Make sure you’re as close to the symphysis pubis as possible (don’t be shy!), and aiming the transducer towards the patient’s feet. Visualization of the bladder is improved prior to emptying of the bladder. Try FAST prior to insertion of a foley catheter or prior to the patient emptying their bladder.\n\n-   **Rib shadows obstructing view in RUQ and LUQ views?** \n    -   Try rotating the transducer obliquely parallel to the ribs in order to fit between an intercostal space. A phased array transducer’s smaller footprint can reduce or eliminate rib shadows.\n\n-   **Can’t see the entire heart on the subxiphoid view?**\n    -   Try moving the probe more to the patient’s right to use the liver as an acoustic window. You can also try increasing the depth of the image.\n\n## Common Errors: Failure to...\n\n-   Fan through entire depth and length of target organs\n-   Perform serial FAST exams in patients who develop changes in their vitals or exam\n-   Appreciate that the FAST exam is not sensitive for the detection of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage or for the identification of solid organ injury\n-   Appreciate that the FAST exam is not sensitive for the detection of small amounts (&lt;400-500 cc) of intra-peritoneal fluid\n-   Appreciate that intra-peritoneal blood will not appear anechoic in patients presenting with delayed trauma. Blood clots typically exhibit mixed echogenicity.\n-   Appreciate that the FAST exam cannot reliably differentiate between ascites and blood in patients with a history of ascites.\n"},"NIH-stroke-scale":{"title":"NIH Stroke Scale","collection":["neurology"],"tags":null,"slug":"NIH-stroke-scale","content":"\n# Stroke Score, NIH Scale\n\n-   Score = 0 (No stroke) \n-   Score = 1-4 (Minor stroke) \n-   Score = 5-15 (Moderate stroke)\n-   Score = 15-20 (Moderate to severe stroke)\n-   Score = 21-42 (Severe stroke) \n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th colspan=\"2\">National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score </th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1a.

A more appropriate approach based on the evidence should be:\n\n1.  Low risk, prior SVT, feels good after conversion, then NO CARDIAC ENZYMES and outpatient f/u\n2.  Intermediate risk, then DO get CARDIAC ENZYMES; If neg, outpatient follow up but if positive consider admission.\n3.  High risk, older age, or known history of ACS, then DO CARDIAC ENZYMES and admit.\n\nMore than one third of patients will have chest pain associated with SVT causing providers to order troponins and other cardiac enzymes. Elevated troponins are not pathognomonic for CAD/ACS and could represent other etiologies such as sepsis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and pulmonary embolism. Also, subsequent coronary angiography is not necessary for risk stratification in all cases. SVT causes a rapid heart rate, which is well documented as a cause for modest troponin elevation secondary to cardiac stretch, poor diastolic perfusion, and/or coronary artery vasospasm.\n\n**[Click here for full ALiEM blog post](http://academiclifeinem.com/svt-are-troponins-necessary/)**\n\n## Do elevated troponins during SVT predict the presence of CAD?\n\n-   12 – 48% of patients have elevated troponins after SVT \\[[Bukkapatnam, 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643248); [Dorenkamp, 2007](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17562784)\\]\n-   Having a known history of CAD is more likely to lead to troponin elevation than not having a history of CAD (62% vs 43%) \\[[Bukkapatnam, 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643248)\\]\n-   There is no difference in the diagnosis of CAD compared to patients with negative troponins  \\[[Bukkapatnam, 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643248)\\]\n-   And if that is not enough, here are 6 studies looking at patients with SVT followed by cardiac angiography.\n\n|  **Author and Date  ** |  **Study Type**                   | **Key Results (Angiography)**                                                                                 |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Kanjwal et al (2008)   | Case Series (7 patients)          | All with NORMAL coronary arteries                                                                             |\n| Miranda et al (2006)   | Case Study                        | NORMAL coronary arteries                                                                                      |\n| Yeo et al (2006)       | Case series (3 patients)          | All with NORMAL coronary arteries                                                                             |\n| Redfearn et al (2005)  | Retrospective Cohort (3 patients) | All with NORMAL coronary arteries                                                                             |\n| Zellweger et al (2003) | Case Series (4 patients)          | 2 patients with NORMAL coronary arteries on angiography and 2 patients with normal myocardial perfusion scans |\n| Bakshi et al (2002)    | Prospective Cohort (3 patients)   | All with NORMAL coronary arteries                                                                             |\n\nTable modified from [Carley S et al Best BETs 2005](http://bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1884)\n**Major Limitations:**\n1.

The authors defined clinically significant outcomes as death, MI, or rehospitalization for a cardiac reason during a 1 year follow up after the SVT event. Several conclusions were made which included:\n\n-   Patients with more comorbidities (risk factors for ACS) are more likely to have elevated troponins with SVT\n-   In comparing elevated versus non-elevated troponin I levels post-SVT, the incidence of adverse outcomes was:\n\n1.  Cardiac rehospitalization: 37.9% versus 6.1%\n2.  Myocardial infarction: 6.9% versus 0% (Not Statistically Significant)\n3.  Death: 20.7% versus 10.2% (Not Statistically Significant)\n\n-   **Major Limitations:**\n    1.  Retrospective Review\n    2.  70% of patients did not have stress test or angiography for follow up\n    3.  Unclear if other etiologies such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, or subarachnoid hemorrhage were cause of elevated troponins\n-   **Conclusion:** Patients with elevated troponins after SVT have **INCREASED** cardiac rehospitalization over the next year\n\n## References\n\n-   [R.N.

Providers should recognize these situations as high risk to both the patient and provider. When patients insist on leaving careful discussion with the patient and specific documentation can hopefully improve outcomes.\n\n## Risks to the Patient\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, patients who leave AMA tend to have an increased risk of having an adverse outcome. Baptist et al. found that asthma patients who left AMA had an increased risk of both relapse and subsequent ICU admissions [1]. Similarly patients with chest pain who left AMA had a higher risk of myocardial infarction than other patients with similar characteristics who stayed in the ED to complete their workup [2].\n\n## Risks to the Providers\n\nPatients who leave against medical advice are up to 10x more likely to sue the emergency physician when compared to other ED patients. Some estimate that 1 in 300 AMA cases results in a lawsuit compared to 1 in 30,000 standard ED visits [3].\n\nWhile posing a particular challenge to providers, there are several basic steps that can be taken when dealing with a patient leaving AMA that can help improve patient outcomes while providing significant medicolegal protection to the providers.\n\n## How to do it Properly\n\n*“The patient looks sober. I told them if they leave that they could die.”*\n\nWhile seen on charts in ED’s across the country, documentation like this offers essentially no legal protection and should not be used. When patients insist on leaving AMA there are eight commonly held standards that should be discussed and documented with all patients.\nBasically the provider needs to establish that the patient is able to make reasonable decisions and in this particular instance was given all the information that would be necessary to make an informed decision.\n\n## Eight Parts of the AMA Process\n\n**1. Capacity**\n\nThis term refers to the patient’s medical ability to make a decision. Documenting that the patient “understood” offers little protection, while documenting a patient’s ability to carry on a conversation and demonstrate reason provides a much more compelling example of their capacity to make decisions. Additionally patients should be noted to be clinically sober as a way to support their capacity. Example: “The patient is clinically sober, free from distracting injury, appears to have intact insight and judgment and reason and in my opinion has the capacity to make decisions.”\n\n**2. Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe patient and provider need to agree on both the patient’s symptoms and also the providers concerns. Example: “The patient presents with abdominal pain. I have explained that I am concerned that this may represent appendicitis; they have verbalized an understanding of my concerns.”\n\n**3. Extent and Limitation of the Exam**\n\nDocument what has been done as well as the limitations that still exist. Example: “I have told the patient that while their labs were normal, they could still have appendicitis.”\n\n**4. Current Treatment Plan**\n\nExample: “I have discussed the need for a CT scan to get more information about potential causes of the patient’s pain.”\n\n**5. Risks of Foregoing Treatment**\n\nSimply documenting “you could die if you leave” is inadequate. Patient should be informed of reasonably foreseeable complications including disability and death. Specific threats such as loss of fertility for testicular/ovarian pathology or loss of vision for ocular complaints should be included when appropriate. Example: “I have told the patient that if they leave and have appendicitis, they could get much worse, could become critically ill, and could possibly become disabled or die.”\n\n**6. Alternatives to Suggested Treatment**\n\nProviders should clearly document the efforts they have made to prevent the patient from leaving AMA. In addition to alternative diagnostics and treatments, discussions with family and friends can be included. Example: “I have offered to give the patient more pain medication. I have asked them to stay in the hospital for serial abdominal exams. I have offered to have an ultrasound performed instead of a CT scan. I have discussed these concerns with the patient’s wife who is at the bedside and she is unable to convince them to stay for further evaluation.”\n\n**7. Explicit Statement of AMA and About What the Patient Refused**\n\nExample: “The patient is not willing to undergo a CT scan. He is unwilling to stay overnight for monitoring. He is refusing any further care and is leaving against medical advice.”\n\n**8. Questions, Follow-up, Medicines, Instructions**\n\nWhen patients leave AMA, providers should do whatever is possible to limit bad medical outcomes. A commonly held misconception is that providing a patient with prescriptions or paperwork somehow negates their AMA status and places the provider at risk. In reality, refusing to provide any discharge medication or instructions only increases the chance that the patient will have a bad outcome, which significantly increases the provider’s risk. For instance, if a patient with pneumonia is leaving AMA, they should be given appropriate antibiotics, and the provider should offer to set up outpatient follow-up. All questions should be answered. Example: “I am unable to convince the patient to stay, I have asked them to return as soon as possible to complete their evaluation. I have spoken with coverage for their primary care doctor in regards to their abdominal pain. I have answered all their questions.”\n\n# References\n\n1. Bitterman RA.

The specific areas include:![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/9/f/541779eb720d8d220ba1d818/640.png)Figure 1: Transducer positions for aortic scan. Proximal (A), Mid-aorta (B), Distal (C), and Longitudinal (D)\n\n## Normal Reference Measurements\n\n-   Aorta from outer wall to outer wall &lt;3 cm\n-   Iliac vessels at bifurcation, outer wall to outer wall &lt;1.5 cm\n\n**Signs of AAA:** Enlarged aorta &gt;3 cm. Most AAA’s are fusiform and are infrarenal. The SMA is a useful landmark as it is in close proximity to the renal arteries, which are often difficult to identify. AAAs often contain a mural thrombus that MUST be included in your measurement of the aneurysm.\n\nFigure 2: Aortic aneurysm (aaa) measuring 6 cm wide with mural thrombus (asterisks).\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/9/f/54177aa2720d8d220ba1d99f/640.png)\n\n## Transverse View\n\nTransducer orientation is transverse with marker towards the patient’s right\n\n1.  Proximal – Midline just below the xiphoid process\n\n2. Mid-Aorta – Midline between xiphoid process and umbilicus\n\n3. Distal - Midline near level of umbilicus\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/9/f/54177bd0b1cece220a275665/640.png)\n\nFigure 3: Proximal aorta transverse view demonstrating the inferior vena cava (ivc), the aorta (ao), the celiac trunk (red arrows) branching into the common hepatic artery (green arrow) and splenic artery (yellow arrow).

Note inferior vena cava (ivc), aorta (ao), anterior cortex of vertebral body (yellow arrows) and superior mesenteric artery (green arrow) with surrounding hyperechoic fat (“clock mantle” sign).\n\n## Longitudinal View\n\nTransducer orientation is sagittal with marker towards the patient’s head \n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/9/f/54177c89b1cece220a27569f/640.png)\n\nFigure 5: Proximal aorta longitudinal view demonstrating the abdominal aorta (red arrows), the celiac trunk (yellow arrow) and the superior mesenteric artery (green arrow). Note that the abdominal aorta becomes more superficial as it descends into the abdomen, following the natural curvature of the spinal column.\n\n## Struggling with the Exam?\n\n**Can’t find the aorta?**\n  -   Use plenty of compression to displace bowel gas – it’s remarkable how much pressure patients tolerate and how much it will improve your view. The vertebral shadow can be used as a landmark as the aorta should be just anterior to the vertebrae. Increase the depth setting until the vertebral shadow is seen. You can start in any segment and follow the aorta proximally or distally. You may also roll the patient on his/her left side or use the liver as a window to find the proximal aorta by using a coronal RUQ view (like a FAST view) with increased depth.\n\n**Not sure if you are scanning proximal vs mid-aortic site?**\n  -   The proximal view should include the celiac trunk and/or the SMA branching from aorta. Both arise anteriorly with the celiac immediately splitting (seagull sign) and the SMA surrounded by bright echogenic fat (Fig 3-4). The mid-aorta does not have these landmarks.\n\n## Common Errors\n\n-   Measuring the lumen instead of the entire vessel.  Abdominal aortic aneurysms often have mural thrombus so be careful to measure outer wall to outer wall to avoid incorrect measurements. \n\n-   Mistaking IVC for aorta. The aorta is on the patient’s left (screen right), has a thicker more echogenic wall, and is round in a transverse view while the IVC is often teardrop shaped.\n\n-   Failing to visualize the entire aorta – you must see it from diaphragm to bifurcation to exclude the presence of an aneurysm.  \n\n-   Relying on ultrasound for the diagnosis of aortic dissection. While a dissection flap can be visualized and should prompt immediate action, failure to visualize a flap by ultrasound does not exclude aortic dissection.\n\n# References\n\n- Tayal VS, et al. *Acad Emerg Med*, 2003.

Is it significant?**\n\n**Main points**\n\n-   Inhaled and IV beta-agonists can contribute to lactic acidosis.\n-   Studies have reported lactate levels &gt;10 mmol/L. \\[[Claret, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21802882); [Creagh-Brown, 2008](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18410827); [Maury, 1997](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9187208)\\]\n-   Asthmatics noted to have an elevated lactate level following beta-agonist therapy should have a thorough assessment for evidence of true tissue hypoperfusion before lactic acidosis is attributed entirely to beta-agonist therapy. \n-   While the use of continuous nebulized beta-agonist therapy is supported by [NIH's EPR-3](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/), patients requiring continuous nebulizers for more than a few hours should have a lactate checked. If a high lactate is found, clinicians should consider whether the rising lactate may be contributing to their patient’s respiratory distress and consider transitioning the patient to less frequent nebulized therapy.\n\n**Click [here](http://academiclifeinem.com/lactic-acidosis-beta-agonist-therapy-asthma/) for full ALiEM original post**\n\n## Causes of lactic acidosis in asthma\n\nA simple respiratory alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder in acute asthma.\\[[Mountain, 1990](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2118447)\\] However, lactic acidosis is frequently identified especially in cases of severe asthma.\\[[Roncoroni, 1976](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=778959); [Appel, 1983](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=6414303); [Raimondi, 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23947392)\\] \n\nPossible causes of lactic acidosis in asthma include:\n\n-   Tissue hypoxia due to hypoxemia and the decrease in venous return caused by elevated intrinsic PEEP\n-   Relative hepatic ischemia and impaired lactate clearance due to venous congestion\n-   Increased respiratory muscle work against constricted upper airways\n-   Beta-agonist therapy \n\n## Beta-agonists role in elevated lactate\n\nCauses of lactic acidosis can be organized into two categories: \\[[Luft, 2001](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11251027), [Anderson, 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24079682)\\]\n\n-   **Type A:** Secondary to tissue hypoxia: shock, cardiac arrest\n-   **Type B:** Lactic acidosis without hypoxia. This can occur through several mechanisms.\n\n  1. Impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (e.g. thiamine deficiency)\n  2. Increased production by neoplastic cells\n  3. Medication-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g. antiretroviral therapy, linezolid, propofol)\n  4. Impaired conversion of lactate to glucose (e.g. hepatic dysfunction)\n\nLactic acidosis caused by β-agonist therapy is a **type B lactic acidosis**. The exact mechanism for the rise in lactate levels seen with beta-agonist therapy is unclear, but stimulation of beta-receptors causes a variety of metabolic effects which may increase lactate production including: \\[[Haffner, 1992](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1353501)\\]\n\n-   Increased glycogenolysis and glycolysis\n-   Increased lipolysis leading to a rise in fatty acids levels which can inhibit conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA\n\n## Beta-agonists-induced lactic acidosis\n\nTwo small prospective studies have addressed this issue:\n\n-   [Rodrigo et al. Emerg Med J 2005](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15911945)\n    -   Enrolled 18 patients with acute severe asthma treated with albuterol 0.4 mg via inhaler every 10 minutes for 2 hours.\n    -   Lactate levels were drawn at baseline and following treatment**. **\n    -   At baseline, all patients had a lactate level &lt;2.2 mmol/L.\n    -   Following treatment, the mean plasma lactate 2.9 mmol/L (significantly higher than baseline) and 4 patients had a lactate of ≥4 mmol/L.\n-   [Rabbat et al. Int Care Med 1998](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9609407)\n    -   Enrolled 29 patients admitted to an ICU with acute severe asthma.\n    -   All patients received protocolized asthma care including frequent salbutamol 10 mg nebulizers and IV salbutamol 1 mg/hr. \n    -   On admission to the ICU, the mean arterial lactate was 3.11 mmol/L (range 1.1-10.4)\n    -   Six hours following admission, arterial lactate levels increased in all patients to a mean of 7.4 mmol/L (2.6-16). The average lactate rise was 4.6 mmol/L. \n    -   An elevated lactate was not found to have any prognostic significance.\n\nMultiple case reports have described a rise in lactate following either inhaled or IV beta-agonist therapy for acute asthma.\\[[Claret, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21802882); [Creagh-Brown, 2008](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18410827); [Maury, 1997](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9187208)\\] Importantly, several case reports have described beta-agonist therapy paradoxically worsening an asthmatic’s clinical course as they struggle to compensate for the rising lactic acidosis.\\[[Maury, 1997](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9187208); [Dodda, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22613097); [Prakash, 2002](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12068341)\\]\n\n## References\n\n-   [Prakash S, Mehta S.

If the left anterior fascicle is blocked, then depolarization in the left ventricle will go toward the lateral leads (I and aVL) and away from the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF).  This means you would expect to see a bigger R wave in leads I and aVL and a bigger S wave in leads II, III, and aVF.\n\n**What are the criteria for LAFB?**\n-   Slightly prolonged QRS duration (Not quite 120 msec or &lt; 3 small boxes)\n-   Left axis deviation\n-   qR complex in leads I and aVL (Depolarization going towards these leads)\n-   rS complex in leads II, III, and aVF (Depolarization going away from these leads)\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/r/8f4e76fb-67ba-5bcc-91d6-317d07c2d394/640.png)\n\n## Left posterior fascicular block (LPFB)\n\nLets now move on to LPFB. In general it is rare to find LPFB in isolation, because it is typically seen with RBBB. For the sake of explanation, if the posterior fascicle is blocked in isolation, then depolarization in the left ventricle will go toward the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) and away from the lateral leads (I and aVL). This means you would expect to see a bigger R wave in leads II, III, and aVF and a bigger S wave in leads I and aVL.\n\n**What are the criteria for LPFB?**\n-   Slightly prolonged QRS duration (Not quite 120 msec or &lt; 3 small boxes)\n-   Right axis deviation\n-   qR complex in leads II, III, and aVF (Depolarization going towards these leads)\n-   rS complex in leads I and aVL (Depolarization going away from these leads)\n-   Absence of right ventricular hypertrophy or prior lateral myocardial infarction\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/r/cfe893f6-917c-5155-a561-a3021ad96da8/640.png)\n\n## Expert Review by Dr. Jeffrey Tabas, MD\n\nImages from [Dr. Tabas' \"Approach to the Critical EKGs\"](http://emonmp3.com/Syllabi/USC_Vegas_EKG_Syllabus_05.pdf)\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/r/8cc75d72-dd7d-5aaa-b931-bed46f238daf/640.png)\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/r/83fbc995-f76b-5c35-b2a4-c297b15feeaa/640.png)\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/r/c672f2cb-d80e-5ac3-bd9c-dc2e9edfdd79/640.png)\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/r/435688bd-0b12-5d22-b995-4a6e1e58a63d/640.png)\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/r/ee633aee-7e4d-5230-94e5-909f0147d605/640.png)\n*My 2 rules of hemiblocks are:* You do not talk about hemiblocks (or fight club). This is because I don’t see much clinical impact from making this diagnosis, and if you put something in your head something else might fall out. If you really must learn them, the easiest approach is that extreme left axis deviation (more negative than -45 degrees) is LAFB and extreme right axis deviation (more than 180) is LPFB. This gets you there 90% of the time. The only significance to the diagnosis is that if the patient has trifascicular block (RBBB, prolonged PR, and a fascicular block) with SYMPTOMATIC bradycardia or syncope from suspected bradycardia with other causes ruled out, they need a pacer, but I think you would admit for that anyway and encourage pacer placement.\n"},"burn-wounds":{"title":"Burn Wounds","collection":["trauma"],"tags":null,"slug":"burn-wounds","content":"\n# Burn Wounds\n\n## American Burn Association Classification (2009)\n\n[EM Clinics of NA 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17400077).

Removal of the patient from the source\n2.  General supportive care\n3.  Administration of oxygen \n\n**4 Key Points by David Juurlink, MD (expert reviewer)**\n\n1. There is more to CO poisoning than carboxyhemoglobin (COHB)\n  - Yes, CO hinders oxygen delivery, and the finding of an elevated COHb level is key to the diagnosis. But its effects aren’t simply those of a functional anemia. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochromes, interferes with mitochondrial function, promotes endothelial damage and peroxidates brain lipids. These effects underlie the neurologic sequelae of CO poisoning, which can be durable and devastating.\n\n2. The diagnosis can be difficult\n\n  - This is true especially in patients with unintentional exposure who don’t present with their entire family in tow. The symptoms are notoriously nonspecific. Maintaining a high index of suspicion is key, and the sooner COHb is measured, the better. The review suggests that heavy smokers can have COHb levels of up to 15%. In fact, most smokers have levels of 8% or lower (Wald et al. Thorax 1981). I’ll go out on a limb and suggest that unless the patient is smoking a cigarette while you’re drawing blood, COHb levels of 10% or higher warrant respect and should not be reflexively attributed to smoking.  \n\n3. Don't forget about cyanide\n\n  - This is a common accompaniment of CO poisoning in victims of residential fires.  Cyanide levels aren’t readily available in most hospitals, and patients with altered mental status, cardiovascular instability and – in particular – elevated lactate levels should be presumed to have concomitant cyanide poisoning and treated accordingly.\n\n4. It's not clear whether hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) does anything of clinical value\n\n  - It clearly speeds the elimination of COHb, but that’s a surrogate for what we really care about: neurologic sequelae. Proponents of HBO often cite the trial of Weaver et al. (NEJM 2002) and the spectacularly uncritical editorial that accompanied it. However, a closer look at the study reveals several serious limitations, chief among them a primary outcome that changed more than once from the trial’s outset to the final publication (Buckley et al, Tox Rev 2005, Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2011 and AJRCCM 2013). [Disclosure: I am a coauthor on these publications.]\n\n  - For clinicians faced with the question of “Should I dive this patient with CO poisoning?” the bottom line on HBO is as follows: We have no idea whether it really reduces the incidence of neurologic sequelae. If it does, it’s not clear which patients stand to benefit, what the appropriate regimen is, or whether the risks and costs of treatment (including the frequent need to transport patients long distances to the nearest chamber) are justifiable. Not surprisingly, different groups have interpreted the available evidence differently, but there are no absolute indications for HBO in patients with CO poisoning. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\n**Click [here](http://academiclifeinem.com/dive-dive/) for full ALiEM blog post and read more about the HBO debate**\n\n## CO levels\n\nMost commonly, CO poisoning is diagnosed by directly measuring carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) percentage in the blood. While the COHb level can lead to a diagnosis, the actual percentage does not correlate well with the clinical signs and symptoms.\n\n**Interpretation of COHb levels:** \\[[Buckley, 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21491385); [Smollin, 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21418677)\\]\n\n-   *Normal (non-smoker, outside of urban area):* 0.4-1.0%\n-   *Urban-dweller:* Up to 5%\n-   *Heavy smoker:* Up to 15%*\\\\Mild poisoning:* &gt;10% without clinical signs/symptoms\n-   *Moderate poisoning:* &gt;10% with minor clinical signs/symptoms (headache, lethargy, fatigue)\n-   *Severe poisoning:* &gt;20-25% with loss of consciousness, confusion, or signs of cardiac ischemia\n\n**Half-life of CO**\nOxygen administration enhances the elimination of CO from the body by decreasing the elimination CO half-life. The CO half-life for the following oxygen levels are as follows: \\[[Kao, 2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15474779); [Smollin, 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21418677); [Wolf, 2008](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18206551)\\] \n\n-   *Room air:* 4-5 hours\n-   *100% O2 by non-re-breather mask:* ~1 hour\n-   *Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO):* ~20 minutes\n\n## Discharging patients\n\nThere is no definite rule or guideline regarding the final disposition of a CO-poisoned patient. Per ****[UpToDate ](http://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-monoxide-poisoning)recommendations: \n\n\"*Any patients with mild symptoms from an unintentional poisoning can be managed in an emergency department and safely discharged. Patients whose symptoms do not resolve, who demonstrate ECG or laboratory evidence of severe poisoning, or who have other medical or social cause for concern should be hospitalized.*\"\n\nMore severe symptoms such as altered mental status, persistent neurologic or cardiovascular dysfunction would also warrant admission.  Also, depending on the mechanism of poisoning, patients may have other co-morbidities that would necessitate admission such as burns, trauma, or hemodynamic instability.\\[[Kao, 2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15474779)\\]\n\n## Hyperbaric oxygen\n\nThe use of HBO to treat CO poisoning remains controversial. Physiologically, it makes sense that if oxygen supplementation is good, more oxygen should be better. However, the few clinical trials that have been done show mixed results. Proponents for HBO therapy point to decreased rates of delayed neurologic sequelae in patients treated with HBO vs normobaric oxygen.  However, the data are conflicting and two studies showed no difference between HBO and normobaric oxygen. \n\n**[2011 Cochrane Collaboration Review](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21491385):**\n“Existing randomized trials do not establish whether the administration of HBO to patients with carbon monoxide poisoning reduces the incidence of adverse neurologic outcomes. Additional research is needed to better define the role, if any, of HBO in the treatment of patients with carbon monoxide poisoning.”\n\n**[2008 ACEP Clinical Policy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18206551)** (Level C recommendation):\n\n1.  HBO is a therapeutic option for CO-poisoned patients; however, its use cannot be mandated.\n2.  No clinical variables, including carboxyhemoglobin levels, identify a subgroup of CO-poisoned patients for whom HBO is most likely to provide benefit or cause harm.\n\nHowever, the **[Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19297574)** does recommend HBO therapy for patients with any of the following: \n\n-   Transient or prolonged loss of consciousness\n-   Abnormal neurologic signs\n-   Cardiovascular dysfunction\n-   Severe acidosis\n-   Age over 36 years\n-   CO exposure of ≥24 hours\n-   Carboxyhemoglobin level ≥25%\n\n**Pregnant patients**\nThere is no clinical trial to date that assessed the efficacy and safety of HBO in pregnant patients.  That said, many experts recommend HBO therapy in the context of pregnancy due to potential benefits to both the mother and fetus, along with difficulty in assessing fetal hypoxia.  Many authors recommend HBO therapy in the pregnant patient if: \\[[Kao, 2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15474779)\\]\n\n1.  Maternal COHb level is ≥15-20%\n2.  Evidence of fetal distress\n3.  Any of the other “standard” criteria \n\n## References\n\n-   [Buckley NA, Juurlink DN, Isbister G, Bennett MH, Lavonas EJ.

The ventricular septum bows to the left, decreasing LV filling. Thus, the SBP drops slightly with inspiration.\n-   In cardiac tamponade, the restrictive pericardial fluid exaggerates the RV filling and compromises LV filling more. This drops the SBP more dramatically with inspiration.\n\n**How to measure pulsus paradoxus**\n1.  Using a manual BP cuff, listen to the brachial artery.\n2.  Inflate the cuff so that no arterial sounds are heard.\n3.  Release the cuff pressure slowly until faintest, intermittent Korotkoff arterial sounds are heard - typically in expiration phase only. Remember this pressure (A). \n4.  Release the cuff pressure further until arterial sounds are heard throughout inspiration and expiration phases. Remember this pressure (B).\n5.  Pulsus paradoxus = A – B.\n\nPulsus paradoxus may help guide decision for pericardiocentesis with equivocal or unavailable echo U/S. If &gt;12 mm Hg, this demonstrates physiologic compromise.\n\n## Bayes Nomogram\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jx/5/m/95730235-4c85-5a59-9dd7-7b66887d4238/640.png)\nDraw a connecting your pre-test probability and your likelihood ratio.

Acclerated Diagnostic Protocol (ADP)\n\n***Is there a way to identify a low risk group who can be discharged home in a timely manner, without further workup, and without short-term adverse events from ACS?***\n\nThe ACC/AHA recommends that chest pain patients, at a minimum, receive an H&P followed by an EKG. After this, risk stratification should be determined as: \n\n-   High risk (needs admission for provocative testing)\n-   Intermediate risk (not an admission, but not yet a discharge)\n-   Low risk (discharge home)\n\n***What do we do about the intermediate and low risk groups in the ED?***\n\nPatients in the intermediate risk group generally need some sort of provocative testing done before disposition can be made. This can be accomplished in an observation unit, or admission to a telemetry unit depending on your place of practice.\n\nThe low risk patients will need serial EKGs and Cardiac Biomarkers. If negative, these patients can be discharged home as outpatients and have provocative testing done within 72 hours. Several questions arise from this:\n\n1.  How far apart do we need to get cardiac enzymes? 6 hours vs 2 hours?\n2.  How long do we need to keep these patients for evaluation? 24 hours vs 12 hours vs 2 hours?\n3.  Is it safe to discharge this low risk group of patients home?\n\n**There are three recent studies ([Than, 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21435709); [Aldous, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22594354); [Than, 2012)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22578923) looking at these very questions using an Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol (ADP). Details about each studies are provided below.**\n\n**Dr. Rezaie's comments about these studies:**\n\n-   All 3 studies were performed by the same group of authors in the same population of patients, which consisted primarily of Caucasian males. It would be nice to see an external validation of this ADP protocol with different ethnicities and more females before implementing it. \n-   TIMI risk score is used as an objective indicator of high, intermediate, and low risk patients. The big problem with this is angina is a subjective complaint. Is the chest pain really angina or some other non-ischemic complaint? This is where clinical judgment is needed, and can be quite different amongst providers. \\[[PV card on TIMI score calculations](https://agile.md/app/modules/517e1695bd169c955c000001/files/5190e4e6bafc41036f00000d?type=document)\\] an indigent patient population, how do we guarantee 72 hour follow up? Do these patients need 72 hour follow up or 30 day follow up? This was not answered in any of these studies and an issue with this protocol.\n-   What is an acceptable miss rate? 1%, 2%, etc? From a public health standpoint the acceptable miss rate is 2 – 5%, but from a lawyers standpoint an acceptable miss rate is 0%.\n\n**Take Home Point**\n\nBefore we implement an accelerated diagnostic protocol as these studies propose, an external validation would be needed with a different patient population for generalizability. If validated, this may help decrease ED length of stay, hospital admissions, and cost of medical care.\n\n****Click [here](http://academiclifeinem.com/chest-pain-part-2-of-3-can-we-do-2-hour-rule-outs/) for full ALiEM blog post****\n\n## The ASPECT Trial\n\n-   **Study: **Prospective, observational \\[[Than, 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21435709)\\]\n-   **Total patients:** 3,582\n-   **What they did:** Identified low risk patients (TIMI of 0; EKG without new ischemic changes; negative Point of Care troponin I, CK-MB, & Myoglobin at 0 & 2 hours) who could be safely d/c home\n-   **Measured outcomes:** Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACEs) at 30 days\n-   **What they found:**\n    -   352 pts (9.8%) were low risk\n    -   3 of 352 pts (0.9%) had MACE\n    -   Sens 99.3%; Spec 11.0%\n    -   NPV 99.1%\n-   **Conclusion:** 9.8% of patients could be discharged home after ADP with 99.3% sens and 99.1% NPV for MACE.\n\n## New Improved ADP\n\n-   **Study:**Prospective, observational \\[[Aldous, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22594354)\\]\n-   **Total patients:** 1,000\n-   **What they did:** Identified low risk patients with ASPECT Trial definition  (TIMI of 0; EKG w/o new ischemic changes; negative Point of Care Troponin I, CK-MB, Myoglobin) and compared with:\n    -   TIMI Score of 0, EKG w/o new ischemic changes, & POC Troponin I only at 0 & 2 hours\n    -   TIMI Score of 0, EKG w/o new ischemic changes, & High Sensitivity Troponin T only at 0 & 2 hours\n    -   TIMI score of 1, EKG w/o new ischemic changes, & POC Troponin I, CK-MB, Myoglobin\n-   **Measured outcomes:** ACS at 30 days\n-   **What they found:**\n    -   123 pts (12.3%) were low risk\n    -   2 of 123 pts (1.6%) identified with ACS at 30 days\n    -   Sens 99.2%; Spec 23.5%\n    -   ADP with POC Troponin I alone or hsTnT alone, had the same sensitivity as POC Troponin I, CK-MB, & Myoglobin, but identified more patients for d/c (15% vs 12.3%)\n    -   Changing TIMI Score = 1 instead of 0, identified 19.7% of pts as low risk, but sens 97% vs 99.2%\n-   **Conclusion:**\n    -   12.3% of patients could be discharged home after ADP with 99.2% sens for ACS\n    -   Using POC TnI or hsTnT identifies a larger population of low risk patients with the same sensitivity as ASPECT Trial.\n    -   Increasing TIMI to 1 instead of 0 increases low risk chest pain population, but decreases sensitivity to 97%.\n\n## The ADAPT Trial\n\n-   **Study**: Prospective observational \\[[Than, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22578923)\\]\n-   **Total patients**: 1,975\n-   **What they did**: Identified low risk patients (TIMI of 0, EKG w/o new ischemic changes, negative troponin I at 0 & 2 hours) who could be safely d/c home\n-   **Measured outcome**: Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACEs) at 30 days\n-   **What they found**\n    -   392 pts (20%) were low risk\n    -   1 of 392 pts (0.25%) had MACE\n    -   Sens 99.7%; Spec 23.4%\n    -   NPV 99.7%; PPV 19%\n-   **Conclusion**: 20% of patients could be discharged home after ADP with 99.7% sens and 99.7% NPV for MACE.\n\n## References\n\n-   [M.

This is even without additional testing, such as CCTAs.\n\n**So are CCTAs worth the cost and potential harms in this low-risk group to add another 1% to the 99% NPV and 99% sensitivity rates? In my opinion, that answer is NO.**\n\n**Click [here](http://academiclifeinem.com/chest-pain-part-3-of-3-coronary-ct-angiography-in-the-ed/) to read the full ALiEM blogpost**.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nIt is well known that taking a good history and physical, getting a non-ischemic EKG, and serial cardiac biomarkers, results in a risk of death/AMI of &lt;5% in 30 days. Patients, in whom you still suspect have CAD, should undergo provocative testing within the next 72 hours based on the AHA/ACC guidelines. Their guidelines deem provocative testing as including:\n\n-   Exercise treadmill stress test,\n-   Myocardial perfusion scan,\n-   Stress echocardiography, and/or \n-   Coronary CT angiography (CCTA).  \n\nMyocardial perfusion scans and stress echos have a sensitivity of 85–90% and specificity of 75–80%. In contrast, CCTA’s have been shown to have a sensitivity of 93-97% and specificity of 80-90%.\n\nRecently two landmark trials ([Litt, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22449295);  [Hoffmann, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22830462)**)** were published in NEJM discussing the use of CCTA in the emergency department. **For details of each trial, see below.**\n\n## **Discussion**\n\nCCTA with 0 lesions is NEGATIVE: These patients can certainly be discharged home with primary care follow up with a nearly 100% NPV for ACS/AMI.\n\nCCTA with &lt;50% lesion is NOT NEGATIVE: This patient has CAD. It may not be clinically significant, but we can see plaques. 2/3 of AMIs occur from plaques that have &lt;50% stenosis. Certainly we can start risk factor modification with beta blockers, ASA, and statins, but there are no studies looking at how this group of patients will do long term.\n\nCCTAs are anatomic studies and not functional studies. Identified lesions will lead to more diagnostic tests, which is one of the big arguments against CCTA. CCTA identifies CAD more often than standard stress modalities, which leads to more heart catheterizations and PCIs. \n\nAs the number of CT slice increases, radiation dose decreases:\n\n1.  A 64 slice CT = 10 – 15 mSv of radiation \n2.  A 128 slice CT = 5 – 10 mSv of radiation \n3.  A 256 slice CT = 1 – 5 mSv of radiation\n4.  In contrast, a single-view CXR = 0.02 mSV of radiation\n\nThere is currently an ongoing National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded trial called the PROMISE (Prospective Multi-center Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) Study with 10,000 patients. Patients with symptoms suggestive of CAD will be randomized to a CCTA vs usual care with a functional test. What’s interesting about this study is it is being performed in the offices of primary care physicians and cardiologists rather than EDs. The study authors hypothesize that medically optimizing patients identified, as having non-obstructive CAD will yield improved long-term outcomes.\n\n## ACRIN-PA Trial\n\n**What they did: \\[[Litt, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22449295)\\]**\n\n-   Non-inferiority study\n-   5 Pennsylvania EDs\n-   1,370 patients, Age &gt; 30 years\n-   Inclusion criteria: TIMI score of 0–2, EKG without ischemic changes, and negative first set of Cardiac Biomarkers\n-   Randomized 2 patients to CCTA arm (908 patients) for every 1 patient to Standard Stress arm (462 patients)\n\n**Primary Outcome:**\n\n-   MI or Death from CAD at 30 days\n\n**Secondary Outcomes:**\n\n-   Rate of discharge from ED\n-   Length of stay (LOS) in ED\n-   Rate of detection of CAD\n-   Resource utilization\n\n**What they found:**\n\n-   640/908 pts (70.5%) who underwent CCTA had coronary stenosis of &lt;50% and none had MI or death due to CAD at 30 days\n-   Discharge from ED 49.6% with CCTA vs 22.7% with standard stress arm\n-   ED LOS 18 hr in CCTA arm vs 24.8 hr in standard stress arm\n\n**Conclusion:** CCTA allows early discharge of low to intermediate risk patients presenting to the ED with possible ACS. \n\n## ROMICAT II Trial\n\n**What they did: \\[[Hoffmann, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22830462)\\]**\n\n-   Randomized controlled trial\n-   9 EDs in the US\n-   1,000 patients with acute chest pain with ages 40–74 years\n-   CCTA (501 patients) versus Standard Evaluation (499 patients)\n\n**Primary Outcome:**\n\n-   Hospital length of stay\n\n**Secondary Outcomes:**\n\n-   Cardiovascular events at 28 days\n-   Rate of discharge from ED\n-   Time to diagnosis\n-   Cost\n-   Utilization of resources\n\n**What they found:**\n\n-   Hospital LOS decreased by 7.6 hr in CCTA group\n-   Rate of discharge from ED 47% in CCTA arm vs 12% in Standard Evaluation Arm\n-   No difference in cardiovascular events at 28 days\n-   Cost was similar between two groups $4,289 CCTA vs $4,060 in Standard arm\n\n**Conclusion:** CCTA decreases length of stay without an increase in rate of cardiovascular events.\n\n## References\n\n-   [Goldstein JA.

Severe chest pain was defined as 9 – 10 on a pain scale of 0 to 10. \n\n-   Risk of AMI with Pain Score of 1 – 8 (82% of patients) = 3.0%\n-   Risk of AMI with Pain Score of 9 – 10 (18% of patients) = 3.9%\n-   Not statistically significant different\n\n**Bottom Line:** Severity of pain is not related to likelihood of AMI at presentation, or composite end points (death, revascularization, or AMI) at 30 days.**\n**\n\n## Body et al., 2010\n\nThe objective was to assessing the value of individual symptoms for predicting a diagnosis of AMI or the occurrence of adverse events (death, AMI, revascularization via PCI or CABG) within 6 months. \n\n-   Strongest positive predictor of AMI\n    -   Diaphoresis with CP\n-   Other positive predictors of AMI and adverse events\n    -   Nausea and vomiting with CP\n    -   CP with radiation to both shoulders &gt; right shoulder &gt; left shoulder\n    -   Central chest pain\n-   Strongest negative predictor of AMI\n    -   Pain located in the left anterior chest\n-   Other negative predictors of AMI and adverse events\n    -   CP described as pain being the same as previous AMI\n    -   Presence of CP at rest\n\n**Bottom Line:** Many “atypical” symptoms are more likely to render the diagnosis of ACS than traditional “typical” symptoms \n\n## Swap et al., 2006\n\nThe authors wanted to identify the elements of a CP history that might be most helpful to the clinician in identifying ACS. They performed a literature search from 1970 to 2005.\n\n**CP characteristics that INCREASE likelihood of ACS/MI:**\n\n| Characteristic                   | \\# of Pt  |  LR |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|-----|\n| Radiating to both shoulders/arms | 893       | 4.1 |\n| Radiating to right shoulder      | 770       | 4.7 |\n| Pain precipitated with exertion  | 893       | 2.4 |\n| Pain associated with diaphoresis | 8,426     | 2.0 |\n\n**CP characteristics that DECREASE likelihood of ACS/MI:**\n\n|  Characteristic                | \\# of Pt  | LR  |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----|\n| Pain that is sharp/stabbing    | 1,088     | 0.3 |\n| Pleuritic pain                 | 8,822     | 0.2 |\n| Positional pain                | 8,330     | 0.3 |\n| Pain reproducible by palpation | 8,822     | 0.3 |\n\n**Bottom Line:** No characteristics of chest pain alone, or in combination, identify a group of patients that can be safely discharge home without further diagnostic testing. Also beware the chest pain which radiates to the RIGHT shoulder (LR = 4.7).\n\n## Goodacre et al., 2002\n\nIn this prospective, observation cohort study of 893 patients, the authors assessed the performance of clinical features used in the diagnosis of CP, specifically in patients who were clinically stable and had a non-diagnostic EKG. \n\n-    Predictive of ACS/AMI:\n    -   Exertional pain\n    -   Pain radiating to both arms &gt; right arm\n-    NOT predictive of ACS/AMI: \n    -   Presence of chest wall tenderness\n    -   Nausea or vomiting\n    -   Diaphoresis\n\n**Bottom Line:** Clinical features have a limited role in triage decision-making for ACS/AMI.\n\n## Panju et al., 1998\n\nThe final study is an oldie but a goodie. The authors aimed to identify clinical features that would increase or decrease the probability of an AMI, presenting with acute chest pain by reviewing the literature (1980-1991).\n\n**Features that INCREASE the probability of an AMI**\n\n|  Clinical Feature                          | LR  |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----|\n| Chest pain that radiates to both arms      | 7.1 |\n| Chest pain that radiates to right shoulder | 2.9 |\n\n**Features that DECREASE the probability of an AMI**\n\n|  Clinical Feature                    |  LR |\n|--------------------------------------|-----|\n| Pleuritic chest pain                 | 0.2 |\n| Chest pain that is sharp or stabbing | 0.3 |\n| Positional chest pain                | 0.3 |\n| Chest pain reproduced by palpation   | 0.3 |\n\n**Bottom Line:** History alone can help, but can NOT rule out ACS/AMI! \n\n## References\n\n-   [M.

From the perspective of the EMS arena, mechanical CPR may be more than just equivalent.\n\n**[Click here for full ALiEM blog post](http://academiclifeinem.com/mechanical-cpr-linc-trial/)**\n\n## The LINC Trial\n\nThe LINC trial was a multicenter, randomized trial, which enrolled 2,589 cardiac arrest patients in Europe into either a mechanical CPR or manual CPR arm.\n\n-   The primary outcome measure was survival after four hours.\n-   Secondary outcomes included neurologic function at ICU discharge, hospital discharge, 1 month, and 6 months.\n-   There was no significant difference in any of the outcome measures between the two groups.\n    -   **4-hour survival rate:** Mechanical compression group (23.6%) versus the conventional CPR group (23.7%)\n    -   **6-month survival rate:** Mechanical compression group (8.5%) versus conventional CPR group (8.1%)\n    -   **6-month good neurologic status** (based on Cerebral Performance category of 1 or 2): Mechanical compression group (99%) versus conventional group (94%)\n-   There are some discrepant details:\n    -   The mechanical CPR group received 3 minute cycles of compressions as opposed to 2 minutes in the manual group (so rescuer fatigue would not be an issue)\n    -   In the mechanical CPR group, defibrillations were given to all patients after 90 seconds of compression without rhythm check to reduce interruptions in compressions (as an unnecessary shock was thought to have less harm than interruptions).\n\n## Prehospital CPR - a unique entity\n\nIn the hospital, the patient generally remains on a gurney with adequate staff to rotate every two minutes per the AHA standards. In a six-story walkup apartment, the situation is different: the initial team consists of two people, one of which needs to gather information, ventilate, obtain access, and give medications while the other does compressions. This is after they just carried their equipment up six flights of stairs. \n\nMany of these resuscitations are pronounced in the field, but not all. On scene, a mechanical CPR device can free up a provider to perform other tasks. During transport, however, is where the benefit of mechanical CPR truly emerges. Imagine performing compression in a stairwell, stopping on each landing to “catch-up” compressions since you can’t carry the person and do compressions simultaneously. Imagine performing compressions in an elevator on an upright patient because there is not enough room to lay the patient flat. Imagine standing up unrestrained in a moving ambulance driving lights and sirens through traffic to perform compressions on a patient.\n\nNone of these situations lend towards effective compressions, and some are even dangerous to providers. This is the reality of prehospital care that cannot be nicely quantified, and this is why proof of equivalency in neurologic outcomes between manual and mechanical CPR is so important.\n\n## References\n\n-   [Rubertsson S, Lindgren E, Smekal D, et al.

By managing patients with severe sepsis and septic shock with an \"early goal directed therapy\" approach, there was an absolute risk reduction of 16%. Furthermore, the number needed to treat to save a life was 6 patients.\n\n## UPDATE: Less invasive techniques to track sepsis \n\nIn the original Rivers' trial, they used computerized spectrophotometric catheters to measure continuous central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). However, if this is not available, other non-invasive measurements can be used as proxy for the ScvO2, especially, if you choose not to have a central line.\n\n[JAMA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20179283) published a landmark study showing that lactate clearance of ≥10% over the first 2 hours is \"not a worse measurement\" than ScvO2 ≥ 70%. \n\n**Using serial lactate measurements** and the less invasive model:\n\n-   Fluid resuscitate through peripheral IV access instead of a central line.  \n-   Follow volume status either with a bedside ultrasound or urine output.\n-   Follow venous lactate levels at time 0 and 2 hours. If the lactate clearance is ≥10% over these 2 hours, you should follow the algorithm as if the ScvO2 ≥ 70%. That means no need for immediate transfusion or vasopressor agents.\n\nTo determine if a patient is adequately volume-resuscitated a patient using bedside ultrasound, measure the IVC diameter about 1-2 cm from the right atrium junction.\n\n-   If the IVC diameter ≤ 1.5 cm and has ≥ 50% collapse with inspiration, the patient has a very low CVP.\n-   If the IVC diameter is at least 1.5 cm and has minimal collapse with inspiration, the patient is euvolemic. Move to the next step -- assessing the MAP.\n\n## References\n\n-   [Jones AE, Focht A, Horton JM, Kline JA.

Note the small **pericardial effusion**.\n\n## Signs of Important Pathology\n\n**Pericardial effusion**: Anechoic (black) stripe encircling the heart. Pericardial effusion on PSLA will track between descending thoracic aorta and left atrium. Pleural effusion will not.\n\n**Pericardial tamponade:** Pericardial effusion with RV free wall collapse in diastole. IVC should be dilated without respiratory variation in tamponade. RA systolic collapse is an early finding. ***Tip*:** Use M-Mode through mitral valve to help with timing of RV collapse.\n\n**Hypovolemia:** Hyperdynamic heart with left ventricular walls almost touching in systole as seen in the parasternal long axis view.\n\n**Right heart strain:** RV size greater than LV (normal ratio is 0.6:1) when seen in the apical 4-chamber view. Flattened septum in parasternal short axis with a D-shaped LV. Poor RV function (size doesn’t change much from systole to diastole).\n\n**Systolic heart failure:** Poor ventricular squeeze. Mitral valve does not open widely as seen in parasternal long-axis. ***EPSS*:** Using the PSLA measured distance between mitral valve and septum in diastole. Abnormal EPSS &gt;7 mm = poor LV ejection fraction.\n\n## Struggling with the Exam?\n\n**Can’t find the heart?**\nPlace the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, which brings the heart closest to the chest wall. Lung artifact is common and asking the patient to exhale can improve your image. Try rib interspaces above and below standard locations.\n\n**Rib shadows obstructing view?**\nTry moving the transducer up or down to get between the ribs, then angle the transducer towards the heart once you have a good acoustic window.\n\n## Common Errors:\n\nPleural effusion can be mistaken for pericardial effusion. To differentiate, locate the descending thoracic aorta in the parasternal long-axis view. Pericardial effusions will track superficial to the descending thoracic aorta. Pleural effusions will track deep.\n\nNon-orthogonal planes can be mistaken for an enlarged right heart or D-sign. Make sure the LV looks round in the PSSA and that the apex is at the top of the screen in the apical windows.\n\nAnterior fat pad can be mistaken for pericardial effusion, but will have internal echos (not anechoic) and will not spread all the way around the circumference of the heart when imaged in different views.\n"},"ectopic-diagnosis":{"title":"Ectopic Pregnancy - Making the Diagnosis","collection":["OBGYN"],"tags":null,"slug":"ectopic-diagnosis","content":"\n# Ectopic Pregnancy: Making the Diagnosis\n\nEctopic pregnancy is the leading cause of maternal death in the first trimester of pregnancy. A [recent JAMA systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23613077), from The Rational Clinical Examination series, looked to risk-stratify women in early pregnancy presenting with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding for ectopic pregnancy, identifying the accuracy and precision of elements in the history, physical examination, beta hCG, and ultrasound in ectopic pregnancy. \n\nThe systematic review consisted of 14 studies (n=12,101). The summary prevalence of ectopic pregnancy was 15% (95% CI, 10-22%) in women presenting with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. \n\n## Background\n\n**Heterotopicpregnancy**: Incidence = 0.3-0.8% (1-3% if assisted reproduction)\n**Ectopic pregnancy:** Incidence = as high as 2.6%\n-   \\#1 cause of 1<sup>st</sup> trimesterpregnancy-related death\n-   8-31% initially diagnosed as “pregnancy of unknown location” (PUL), despite beta- HCG and ultrasonography\n-   More than half of patients with ectopic pregnancy will have ZERO risk factors\n\n**Discriminatory zone:** Serum beta-HCG level cutoff above which intrauterine pregnancy is likely visible on US.\n-   Variable definition of cutoff with range of1,500-3,000 mIU/mL\n-   No single serum beta-HCG value is predictive of anectopic pregnancy\n-   If beta-HCG above 3,000 mIU/mL and an “emptyuterus” on US, suggestive of ectopic pregnancy\n\n<!-- -->\n\n## Diagnostic Tools to Risk Stratify\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jx/5/m/a6a7317a-b855-5fd8-b6ad-133e8ccfc513/640.png)\n**Ultrasound:**\n\n-   Findings of an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) such as gestational sac or fetal pole ruled out ectopic pregnancy, except in rare cases of heterotropic prengnacy.\n-   Bedside ultrasound is the single most useful diagnostic test.

Shown is a **gestational sac** containing a **yolk sac** and within the **endometrium.**\n\nBoth of these windows include a complete sweep through the uterus in each direction looking for a gestational sac and yolk sac or fetal pole within the endometrium.\n\n## Interpretation and Tips\n\nAn IUP for point-of-care purposes is defined as a yolk sac or fetal pole within a gestational sac within the endometrium. This indirectly excludes an ectopic pregnancy in an appropriate clinical setting.\n\nConsider measuring the distance between the gestational sac and the edge of uterus. If this endomyometrial mantle thickness is &lt;8 mm, then consider the possibility of an interstitial ectopic pregnancy.\n\nAn ectopic pregnancy will occasionally be seen as an extrauterine mass. However, free fluid in a pregnant patient without an IUP should also be considered an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.\n\n## Pitfalls\n\n**Inserting the transducer too deeply.** The transducer should be inserted to the cervix, using it as a window. If you continue to push once at the cervix, the transducer will frequently slide into the posterior fornix and only bowel/rectum will be seen.\n\nScanning with a full bladder. While the transabdominal approach is enhanced by a full bladder, the patient should empty their bladder prior to transvaginal scanning to improve visualization.\n\n**Calling a gestational sac an IUP.** At least a yolk sac is needed. A pseudogestational sac with an ectopic pregnancy is possible.\n\nRelying on the quantitative beta-HCG and “discriminatory zone” for decision-making. Over 40% of ectopic pregnancies will have beta-HCG levels below the discriminatory zone.\n\n**Considering an “inconclusive scan” negative for ectopic**. Ectopic pregnancies are almost always ruled-out by finding an IUP. Absence of an extrauterine mass does not exclude ectopic pregnancy.\n\n**Failure to recognize specific high-risk populations.** Patients undergoing assisted reproductive therapy have a much higher (1-3%) incidence of heterotopic pregnancy. Identification of an IUP does not exclude a co-existing ectopic in this group.\n"},"first-trimester-ultrasound":{"title":"Focused 1st Trimester Pregnancy Transabdominal Ultrasound","collection":["radiology","ultrasound","obgyn"],"tags":null,"slug":"first-trimester-ultrasound","content":"\n# Ultrasound: Focused 1st Trimester Pregnancy (Transabdominal Exam)\n\nMatt Lipton, MD, Mike Mallin, MD, Mike Stone, MD\n\nWang R., et al. *Annals of Emerg Med,* 2011.

Fetal heart rate (FHR) between 120-160 bpm (can be as low as 100 bpm in early gestation)\n2.  Myometrium surrounding the IUP should be ≥ 8mm (endomyometrial mantle)\n\n**How to use the serum quantitative beta-HCG**\n\n-   Do not to use a single beta-HCG data point alone in ED patient management.\n-   There is no cutoff value that has been shown to adequately identify those patients for which an IUP should be visualized.\n-   Order the test if you are unable to find an IUP because Ob/Gyn consultants will want to trend the value. \n-   **DO NOT** use a quantitative beta-HCG as a reason not to perform a bedside ultrasound. Many patients with ectopic pregnancy have values below the traditional cutoff of 2,000-2,500 mIU/mL.\n\n## Signs of Ectopic Pregnancy\n\n-   **Failure to identify an IUP** is the first indication that an ectopic may be present.\n-   Other signs include: Free fluid in the pelvis and/or masses in the adnexa\n-   An ectopic pregnancy in the tube or ovary often has a “ring of fire” with color Doppler imaging. However, most ectopic pregnancies are not visible with transabdominal ultrasound.\n-   **Free intraperitoneal fluid** in Morison’s pouch is a **sign of a ruptured ectopic** that will likely require operative intervention.\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jz/1/c/95a91308-e91e-5bd8-83c7-443c09312b7a/640.png)Figure 3: **Empty fluid-filled sac** within the endometrium. Given the absence of contents, you cannot differentiate gestational vs pseudogestational sac.\nThis is **not** diagnostic of an IUP.\n\n## Struggling with the Exam?\n\n**Can’t visualize the uterus?**\nPerform the ultrasound before the patient urinates. If unable to visualize key structures, proceed to a transvaginal ultrasound.\n\n**Can’t find a yolk sac or fetal pole?                                                                       **\n\n1.  **There may not be an IUP**. The patient may have an ectopic pregnancy or a OOcompleted abortion.\n2.  **It may be too early** to visualize an IUP with transabdominal scanning. IUPs are difficult to visualize before 6-6.5 weeks gestational age. This may require a transvaginal ultrasound instead, which can visualize earlier IUPs.\n\n## Common Errors\n\nOnly using close-up, zoomed view to evaluate for intrauterine pregnancy. Be sure to get a “big picture” view of the pelvis to identify all relevant structures prior to using the zoom function.\n\n**Mistaking a pseudogestational sac for an IUP**: A pseudogestational sac is a small fluid collection from an endometrial reaction to hormones produced by the ectopic pregnancy. This will appear within the endometrial cavity and can be seen in up to 20% of ectopic pregnancies. You **MUST** visualize at least a yolk sac within a gestational sac (located in the endometrium) before an IUP can be confirmed.\n\n**Interstitial (cornual) pregnancy**: Although most ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tubes, 3% of ectopic pregnancies implant on the edge of the uterus. This form of ectopic pregnancy can be identified by noting an eccentric location of the gestational sac within the endometrium, often with &lt;8 mm of surrounding myometrium.\n\nAssuming an IUP rules-out an ectopic pregnancy for those undergoing assisted reproductive therapies (ART) such as in-vitro fertilization. The risk of a heterotopic pregnancy is too high.\n\nUsing pulsed wave or color Doppler on the fetus to confirm fetal heart rate or viability. Both pulse wave and color Doppler inflict unnecessary thermal energy to the developing fetus. M-Mode is sufficient for measuring fetal heart rate.\n"},"gallbladder-ultrasound":{"title":"Focused Biliary Assessment","collection":["radiology","ultrasound","gastroenterology"],"tags":null,"slug":"gallbladder-ultrasound","content":"\n# Ultrasound: Focused Biliary Assessment\n\nJohn Eicken, MD and Mike Stone, MD\n\nSummers SM et al. *Annals of Emerg Med,* 2010.

Try having the patient take a deep breath and hold it.\n\n**Can’t find the CBD?**\nFrom the intercostal window, identify the gallbladder in a short axis. Slowly angle the ultrasound beam towards the patient’s head, passing all the way through the gallbladder and continuing upwards. The CBD will be seen in a long axis, just superficial to the portal vein. Use color Doppler to distinguish the CBD from the hepatic artery and portal vein.\n\n**Rib shadows obstructing view?**\nTry rotating the probe obliquely to mirror the angle of the intercostal space.  If unsuccessful, you can ask the patient to take and hold a deep breath to bring the gallbladder below the ribs.\n\n## Common Errors: Failure to…\n\nBowel gas can cause indistinct “dirty” shadowing. Be sure shadows originate from discrete hyperechoic foci (stones) within the gallbladder lumen.\n\nEdge artifact can cause shadows from the sides of the gallbladder due to refraction.\n\nScan all the way through the gallbladder to avoid missing stones in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, common causes of acute biliary colic and cholecystitis. Be thorough!\n\nSmaller stones can be missed with some portable ultrasound systems. A comprehensive study may be warranted in cases of moderate/high pre-test probability with a normal point-of-care study.\n\nPolyps within the gallbladder can often be differentiated from gallstones by changing the patient’s position and assessing for movement - polyps should remain stationary and gallstones should move with gravity (unless impacted in the neck). Additionally, polyps should not create posterior shadowing as is seen with gallstones.\n\nBiliary sludge appears as an echogenic layer of fluid without associated posterior shadowing within the gallbladder.\n"},"genital-ulcers":{"title":"Genital Ulcers","collection":["infectious disease","genitourinary"],"tags":null,"slug":"genital-ulcers","content":"\n# Genital Ulcers\n\n-   Leading causes in the US: HSV types 1 and 2 (most common) &gt; syphilis &gt; chancroid\n-   Note: 10% of chancroid are coinfected with syphilis or HSV\n\n## Differential diagnosis of genital ulcers\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Infectious (more common)</th>\n    <th>Non-infectious (less common)</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      Genital herpes simple virus (HSV)<br>\n      Syphilis<br>\n      Chancroid<br>\n      Lymphogranuloma venereum<br>\n      Granuloma inguinale (donovanosis)<br>\n      Fungal infection (eg. candida)<br>\n      Secondary bacterial infection\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      Behcet syndrome<br>\n      Fixed drug eruption<br>\n      Psoriasis<br>\n      Sexual trauma<br>\n      Wegener granulomatosis\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n[National Coalition of STD Director Fact Sheets](http://www.ncsddc.org/publications)\nFrom “The Practitioner’s Handbook for the Management of STDs” (4th ed, 2007):\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>Primary HSV</th>\n    <th>Recurrent HSV</th>\n    <th>Syphilis</th>\n    <th>Chancroid</th>\n    <th>LGV</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Primary lesion**</td>\n    <td>Vesicle, papule,ulcers, typically bilateral</td>\n    <td>Grouped vesicles, papules, ulcers, typically unilateral  </td>\n    <td>Ulcer, papule</td>\n    <td>Ulcer, papule</td>\n    <td>Papule, pustule, ulcer</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Border**</td>\n    <td>Erythematous,\"punched out\"  </td>\n    <td>Erythematous,\"punched out\"</td>\n    <td>Sharply demarcated </td>\n    <td>Violaceous, undermined</td>\n    <td>Variable</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Depth**</td>\n    <td>Superficial</td>\n    <td>Superficial</td>\n    <td>Superficial</td>\n    <td>Excavated</td>\n    <td>Superficial</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Base**</td>\n    <td>Red and smooth</td>\n    <td>Red and smooth</td>\n    <td>Red and smooth</td>\n    <td>Yellow to gray exudate</td>\n    <td>Variable</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Secretion**</td>\n    <td>Serous</td>\n    <td>Serous</td>\n    <td>Serous</td>\n    <td>Purulent to hemorrhagic</td>\n    <td>Variable</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Number of Lesions**</td>\n    <td>Bilateral, multiple, extensive lesion may coalesce</td>\n    <td>Usually unilateral; labia, penis, scrotum, buttocks, perianal</td>\n    <td>Vulva, penis, anal perianal, oral</td>\n    <td>Penis, vulva</td>\n    <td>Urethra, cervix, rectum</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Induration**</td>\n    <td>None</td>\n    <td>None</td>\n    <td>Firm</td>\n    <td>Rare, usually soft</td>\n    <td>None</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Pain**</td>\n    <td>Common</td>\n    <td>Common, less severe</td>\n    <td>Rare</td>\n    <td>Often</td>\n    <td>Variable</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Itching**</td>\n    <td>Common</td>\n    <td>Common</td>\n    <td>Rare</td>\n    <td>Rare</td>\n    <td>Rare</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Lymph Nodes**</td>\n    <td>Tender, firm, bilateral inguinal adenopathy</td>\n    <td>Lymphadenopathy, uncommon, unilateral</td>\n    <td>Nontender, firm, enlarged</td>\n    <td>Tender, enlarged, may suppurate</td>\n    <td>Inguinal and femoral lymphadenopathy: tender, may suppurate</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Incubation Period**</td>\n    <td>2-14 days</td>\n    <td>Recurrence within 6-9 months of primary infection </td>\n    <td>10-90 days</td>\n    <td>1-14 days</td>\n    <td>3-21 days</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Time Course**</td>\n    <td>21 days</td>\n    <td>7-10 days</td>\n    <td>2-3 weeks</td>\n    <td>2-3 weeks</td>\n    <td>1-2 weeks</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>**Diagnostic Test**</td>\n    <td>Viral culture</td>\n    <td>Viral culture is most sensitive, especially once vesicles rupture and ulcerate.

What’s not acceptable is under-treating pain or inadequately sedating a stable patient.\n-   You should **take all the usual precautions**, and consider any co-morbidities that could make the patient more at risk of adverse reactions or complications, more difficult to bag or intubate, or more at risk of decompensation from limited physiologic reserve.\n-   Older patients **usually require lower doses of medications**. They tend to be more sensitive to medications, with slower metabolism, less physiologic reserve to handle side effects, and a smaller volume of distribution.\n-   Older patients may be at **higher risk for oxygen desaturation, **but they usually responds quickly to supplemental oxygen.\n\n**Click [here](http://academiclifeinem.com/putting-an-older-patient-under-tips-for-geriatric-procedural-sedation/) for full ALiEM blog post**\n\n## OPIOIDS AND BENZODIAZEPINES\n\nThis is a popular combination, and is generally tolerated well in older adults. There is a body of dental literature on sedation for the many older patients who undergo extractions and other dental procedures.\n\n-   In [one study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1308376) in which they gave sequential doses of <span class=\"drug\">diazepam</span> and titrated it to clinical conscious sedation, they found that **lower doses were required to reach the same level of sedation in older patients**. Patients over 80 years old required 0.1 mg/kg <span class=\"drug\">diazepam</span>, while those age 30-39 required over 2.5 mg/kg on average. **Oxygen saturation declined slightly more in older patients**, and this occurred within the first few minutes following administration of the medication.\n-   In another study with 200 patients (age 65 or over) undergoing brief dental procedures, there were** no serious complications seen** with <span class=\"drug\">fentanyl</span> plus <span class=\"drug\">diazepam</span> or <span class=\"drug\">midazolam</span>. <span class=\"drug\">Midazolam</span> was not available at the start of the study, but is preferred due to its shorter half-life. The mean <span class=\"drug\">fentanyl</span> dose was 100 mcg, for <span class=\"drug\">diazepam</span> was 9.2 mg, and for <span class=\"drug\">midazolam</span> 3.9 mg. They also used small boluses of <span class=\"drug\">methohexital</span> for amnesia, with a mean dose of  60.3 mg. They pretreated all patients with 100-500 mL of IV fluids, and patients had been NPO for solids for 8 hours, and clear liquids for at least 3 hours. \\[[Campbell, 1997](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9481963)\\] \n-   Comparing patients under 60 years old, who received 0.05 mg/kg of <span class=\"drug\">midazolam</span>, with those over 60 years old who received 0.025 mg/kg <span class=\"drug\">midazolam</span> for colonoscopy, even with the lower dose, **the older patients experienced more frequent desaturation.** \\[[Yano, 1998](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9951880)\\] \n\n## PROPOFOL\n\nThis agent is also generally tolerated well in older adults, and is the preferred, first-line agent in many EDs. As with any patient, pay attention to the blood pressure, and an alternative agent may be preferable for those with hypotension.\n\n-   In an [ED study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20825829) of sedation with <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> +/- opioid or <span class=\"drug\">midazolam</span> + opioid, they looked specifically at complication rates including hypotension, apnea, hypoxia, aspiration, need for rescue maneuvers, bradycardia, and death. There was **no statistically significant difference in complication rates** in patients age 18-49, 50-64, and ≥65, with rates of 5.2%, 5.4%, and 8%, respectively (p 0.563). However,** the dose of sedative medications used decreased with both age and ASA score.**\n-   For patients receiving <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> alone in another ED study, **older patients required a lower dose**. There were three age groups: 18-40, 41-64, and ≥65 years. The median induction doses were 1.4 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 0.9 mg/kg, and the median total doses required were 2 mg/kg, 1.7 mg/kg, and 1.2 mg/kg. \\[[Patanwala, 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23333181)\\] \n-   Finally, [a study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21824314) that included patients up to age 60 noted **that those who were 50-60 years old experienced airway complications more frequently than younger patients**. Airway complications such as obstruction, desaturation, or hypoventilation requiring an intervention (stimulation, chin-lift, bag-valve mask, or OPA) occurred at a rate of 31% in the 50-60 year age-group, compared with 21% overall. There were **more airway events if the level of sedation was deep** (odds ratio doubled for a sedation level of 6 compared with sedation level 4). Airway events were more common in patients who had received propofol, midazolam, or fentanyl. However, the interventions were relatively minor, and no patients required intubation during the procedure (one patient aspirated and was intubated later).\n\n## KETAMINE\n\nWhile <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> has become a favorite agent in many EDs and has been used successfully in children for many years, it is probably NOT the best first choice in certain older adults.\n\n-   There are a number of older, small [studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7158270) of <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> used as the sole agent in the OR to perform open reduction and intern fixations of hip fractures in older adults. In [a study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7124316) with an average patient age of 83 years, during <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> administration, **patients experienced increased blood pressure and cardiac index**, but there were no serious adverse events. Another [small study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3259087) compared <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> and <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> as the sole agents during hip fracture repair in the OR, and found that **ketamine increased myocardial oxygen demand.**\n-   In general, there is a higher prevalence of hypertension and coronary artery disease among older patients. Increasing the myocardial oxygen demand could present a risk with <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> use.  However, there is little evidence one way or the other (if you find good papers with adequate numbers of older patients, please post in the comments!) <span class=\"drug\">Ketofol</span> may be good option (combination <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> and <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span>), but the recent studies of ketofol in the ED enrolled few older patients \\[[Andolfatto (2012)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22401952), [Willian (2006)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17059854)\\].\n\n## ETOMIDATE\n\n<span class=\"drug\">Etomidate</span> is not as often used as a first-line agent. It has the unpleasant side effect of myoclonus. However, it is otherwise generally well-tolerated in older adults, and is still a common first-line medication for intubation.\n\n-   In a small, [retrospective comparison](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21030192) of older and younger adults who received <span class=\"drug\">etomidate</span> for procedural sedation, **there was no statistically significant difference between the complication rate in older (20%) and younger (14.8%) adults**, and their rates of complication were similar to prior studies. The average <span class=\"drug\">etomidate</span> dose was 0.14 mg/kg for the younger and older adults. Most patients received an opioid and/or low dose benzodiazepine in addition. Of the 45 elderly patients included in their study, 3 had emesis without aspiration, 2 suffered hypoxia that resolved within 5 minutes with supplemental oxygen, 1 had bradycardia that resolved, 3 had asymptomatic hypertension, and one had fasciculations.\n\n## References\n\n-   [D.M.

The spectrum of hyperthyroidism ranges from asymptomatic or subclinical disease to thyroid storm. So how do we diagnose various presentations of hyperthyroidism in the Emergency Department? \n\nBelow are answers to 7 common questions that commonly arise.\n\n**Click [here](http://academiclifeinem.com/diagnosing-hyperthyroidism/) for full ALiEM blog post**\n\n## Hyperthyroidism vs. Thyrotoxicosis vs. Thyroid Storm\n\n-   **Hyperthyroidism** refers to conditions in which the production of thyroid hormone is increased.\n-   **Thyrotoxicosis** is any state where the concentration of thyroid hormone is increased in the circulation, which includes overproduction, release from an injured gland, or exogenous hormone.\n-   **Thyroid storm** is a life-threatening decompensation of thyrotoxicosis, with extremes in clinical symptoms including fever, marked tachycardia, CNS and GI dysfunction, with decompensation of one organ system, such as shock or heart failure. [1]\n\nHave a low suspicion to screen for hyperthyroidism in patients who have symptoms that cannot be explained by other causes. Fatigue and generalized weakness is very common, along with weight loss and decreased appetite. Neuropsychiatric complaints include anxiety, tremor, insomnia, and emotional lability. Cardiopulmonary symptoms are very common and include palpitations, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and dyspnea on exertion. In these patients, examining their thyroid for enlargement or nodules is helpful, and a screening TSH should be part of their workup. [Marx, 2010]\n\n## Thyroid Storm\n\nThyroid storm is a clinical diagnosis. Pay attention to certain features in the history, vitals, and exam: \n\n1.  **Underlying hyperthyroidism** – Most common in patients with a history of Graves’ disease, and occasionally in toxic multinodular goiter and toxic adenoma\n2.  **Fever** – Thyroid storm patients have lost the ability to vasodilate and thermoregulate. Temperature can exceed 104-106 F.\n3.  **Altered mental status** – A key to diagnosis. This ranges from restlessness to delirium, seizures, or coma.\n4.  **Suspected precipitating event** – Common causes include infection, trauma, surgery, and excessive diuresis.\n\nOther signs and symptoms can include marked tachycardia (can be &gt;140 bpm), congestive heart failure, and GI symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n\nHyperthyroidism is especially difficult to diagnose in the elderly, who will often not show overt physical signs. Clues to diagnosis include supraventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, inappropriately youthful skin.\n\nThyroid storm has a high mortality rate.  Bottom line: if you suspect it, treat it. [Lopresti, 2013]\n\n## Labs to diagnose hyperthyroidism\n\nSerum TSH measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test. A normal TSH essentially excludes hyperthyroidism (except in the rare circumstance of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance). Measurement of thyroid hormone levels (free T4 and free T3) is subsequently required for definitive diagnosis. \n\nOther lab abnormalities seen in hyperthyroidism include anemia, thrombocytopenia, low creatinine (cannot convert creatine to creatinine), hyperglycemia, and hypercalcemia. \\[[Bahn, 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21510801); [Ross, 2001](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11444162)\\]\n\n## DDX of low TSH\n\n| **TSH** | **Free T4** | **Free T3** | **Condition**                                                                                                                                      |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Normal  | Normal      | Normal      | None                                                                                                                                               |\n| Low     | High        | High        | Hyperthyroidism                                                                                                                                    |\n| Low     | Normal      | Normal      | Subclinical hyperthyroidism                                                                                                                        |\n| Low     | Normal      | High        | T3 toxicosis                                                                                                                                       |\n| Low     | High        | Normal      | Thyroiditis, T4 ingestion, hyperthyroidism in chronic illness                                                                                      |\n| Low     | Low         | Low         | Euthyroid sick syndrome, central hypothyroidism \\[<span class=\"aglmd-moreinfo ui-moreinfo\" data-iid=\"53aa254cd35d3ae92e0049ce\">Marx, 2010</span>\\] |\n\n## Hyperthyroidism and pregnancy\n\nTSH levels in the first half of pregnancy may normally be lower than the non-pregnant population, due to stimulation of the thyroid by serum bHCG. In the second half of pregnancy, TSH levels will return back to normal. Due to variations in thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), free T3 and free T4 levels are also trimester-specific and each laboratory has their own reference values.\n\nAccording to [2011 Guidelines from American Thyroid Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21787128), normal TSH levels in pregnancy are:\n\n-   First trimester: 0.1-2.5 mIU/L\n-   Second trimester: 0.2-3.0 mIU/L\n-   Third trimester: 0.3-3.0 mIU/L \n\n## Measuring TSH for palpitations or AFib \n\nSo far there have been no studies performed on the prevalence of hyperthyroidism in undifferentiated patients with palpitations. In a large study of patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation, less than 1% were caused by overt hyperthyroidism. Therefore, although serum TSH is typically measured in the inpatient and primary care settings in patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation or palpitations, this association is uncommon in the absence of additional symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism. Thus it is not a specific recommendation in the emergency department setting without other signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism. \\[[Krahn, 1996](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8885821)\\]\n\n## References\n\n-   [Krahn AD, Klein GJ, Kerr CR, Boone J, Sheldon R, Green M, Talajic M, Wang X, Connolly S.

Wrap with blankets.\n2.  **Active External Rewarming:** applying heat to skin\n    -   Heating blanket or radiant heat\n    -   Hot water bottles or heating pads to truncal surfaces. Caution-- do not burn skin.\n    -   Risk of “Core Temperature Afterdrop”, vasodilation with active external rewarming causes cold peripheral blood to return to heart. Give warm IV fluid beforehand.\n    -   Risk of “Rewarming Acidosis”. Lactate from periphery returns to core circulation. May cause transient shock during rewarming.\n\n3.  **Active Core Rewarming**\n\n    -   Humidified air, 40°C (104°F) – increases core temp by 1-2.5°C (1.8-4.5°F) per hr\n    -   Warm IV fluids at 40-45°C\n    -   Cardiopulmonary bypass or hemodialysis, Increases core temp by 1-2°C (1.8-3.6°F) every 3-5 minutes\n    -   Warm fluid lavage of stomach, colon, bladder, pleural space\n    -   Peritoneal dialysis. Normal saline at 40-45°C at 6-10 L/hr increases core temp by 1-3°C (1.8-5.4°F) per hour when combined with heated oxygen.\n    -   Mediastinal lavage via open thoracotomy\n\n## Choosing a rewarming approach\n\n**General approach:**\n\n-   Check glucose.    \n-   Consider thiamine 100 mg IV, esp if chronic EtOH at risk for Wernicke’s    \n-   Treat underlying etiology for hypothermia \n-   Give antibiotics +/- steroids, as appropriate   \n\n**If patient in cardiopulmonary arrest:**\n\n-   Intubate, CPR, ACLS protocol\n-   Warm IVF\n-   Heated humidified oxygen\n-   Extracorporeal rewarming (i.e. cardiopulmonary bypass), if not immediately available, do active core rewarming measures\n-   Rewarm to target temperature &gt;30°C (86°F)\n\n\n**If NOT in cardiopulmonary arrest AND temperature &lt;32°C (89.6°F):**\n\n-   Active External Rewarming (i.e. Bair Hugger, warm blankets), and\n-   Minimally invasive Active Core Rewarming (warm IVF, warm air)\n\n\n**If NOT in cardiopulmonary arrest AND temp ≥32°C (89.6°F):**\n\n-   Passive external rewarming measures    \n\n## References\n\n-   [McCullough L, Arora S.Diagnosis and treatment of hypothermia.Am Fam Physician. 2004 Dec 15;70(12):2325-32.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15617296)\n"},"increased-osmolar-gap":{"title":"Approach to Increased Osmolar Gap","collection":["toxicology"],"tags":null,"slug":"increased-osmolar-gap","content":"\n# Approach to Increased Osmolar Gap\n\nSerum osmolality: Contributed by ions and low-molecular-weight solutes\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jx/7/i/9477ab28-cd8b-5d64-ba05-cf8b70bab831/640.png)\n\n**Osmolal gap = calculated osmolality – measured osmolality**\n\n-   (normal is -10 to +10 mOsm/kg of H2O)\n\n**Osmolal gap**\n\nMost common cause = Ethanol \n\n-   Gap calculation includes ethanol correction factor (4.6)\n\nScreens for toxic alcohols with decreasing sensitivity (increasing molecular weight): Methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol\n\nGap ≥ 20 suggests ethanol or toxic alcohol exposure\n\n-   Although case reports of DKA causing osmolal gap ≥ 20\n\n**Toxic alcohols**\n\n-   Parent unmetabolized alcohols --&gt; Contributes to osmolal gap\n-   Metabolites of alcohols --&gt; Contributes to toxic effects (except isopropanol)\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th> Causes for High anion gap metabolic acidosis + High osmolal gap</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Acute kidney injury<br />\n\nIntoxication, salicylates<br />\n\nIntoxication, toxic alcohol<br />\n\n<ul>\n<li>Methanol</li>\n<li>Ethylene glycol</li>\n<li>Diethylene glycol</li>\n<li>Propylene glycol</li>\n<li>Isopropanol glycol</li>\n</ul>\nKetoacidosis, alcoholic or diabetic<br />\n\nLactic acidosis<br />\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n**Caution**\n\n-   Toxic alcohols may not cause significant osmolal gap because \n-   High molecular weight toxic alcohols (eg. propylene glycol, diethylene glycol) do not affect the osmolality as much\n-   Wide range of normal osmolal gap (can be as low as -10)\n-   Only the parent alcohol (not the metabolites) causes osmolal gap\n\n**Tip: **Consider toxic alcohols for cases of high anion gap metabolic acidosis even with normal osmolal gap\n\n## References\n\n-   [Kraut JA, Xing SX.

When troubleshooting, check all the parts.\n-   A pump often will not indicate that anything is wrong, even if insulin is leaking or the needle isn’t properly positioned.\n-   Cellulitis at the insertion site is common often caused by poor cleaning or keeping the needle in too long. If it is mild, it will usually get better by just removing the needle.\n-   Pumps are no match for a Bundt cake. Patients still need to check their glucose levels regularly, because they can become hyperglycemic if they don’t make appropriate adjustments.\n-   Pumps use short-acting insulin, and patients using them have little to no reservoir. When pumps fail, DKA is just around the corner!\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/l/2fa8b5a2-0bff-53dc-bd2b-cdc6b86e3773/640.png)\n\n**Click [here](http://academiclifeinem.com/insulin-pumps-understanding-them-and-complications/) for full ALiEM blog post**\n\n## BACKGROUND ON INSULIN PUMPS\n\nWhile the rate of diabetes climbs, the number of patients who are using insulin pumps grows apace. Pumps appeal to physicians because they mimic normal insulin physiology with a consistent basal rate and appropriate bolus doses for meals. This leads to tighter glucose control and smaller variations. For patients, the pumps can be liberating, requiring far fewer injections than a typical multi-dose regimen. Regardless of why your patient has an insulin pump, it helps to know about how they work… for when they don’t.\n\nPumps are not a replacement for a fully-functioning pancreas. In technical terms, insulin pumps are an open system – they deliver a constant rate of insulin, but it is still up to patients to determine where their blood sugar is and where it may trend. Thus, patients with pumps still need to count carbs, and check their glucose frequently (often more frequently than those on multi-dose regimens) \\[[Hoogma, 2006](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16433711)\\].\n\n## ANATOMY OF THE INSULIN PUMP\n\nGenerally, insulin pumps consist of a reservoir, a microcontroller with battery, flexible catheter tubing, and a subcutaneous needle. When the first insulin pumps were created in the 1970-80′s, they were quite bulky (think 1980′s cell phone). In contrast, most pumps today are a little smaller than a pager. The controller and reservoir are usually housed together. Patients often will wear the pump on a belt clip or place it in a pocket. A basic interface lets the patient adjust the rate of insulin or select a pre-set. The insulins used are rapid acting, and the reservoir typically holds 200-300 units of insulin. The catheter is similar to most IV tubing (often smaller in diameter), and connects directly to the needle. Patients insert the needle into their abdominal wall, although the upper arm or thigh can be used. The needle infusion set can be attached via any number of adhesives, but tape can do in a pinch. The needle needs to be re-sited every 2-3 days \\[[Richardson, 2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507228); [Pickup, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16912828)\\].\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/l/92f4e72e-e416-5daa-bbcb-4f80be5dea84/640.png)\n\n## COMPLICATIONS FROM INSULIN PUMP USE\n\nThe most common complications of insulin pump therapy involve the skin and soft tissue.\n\n1.  Local reactions to tape and adhesives are common.\n2.  Local allergic reactions to insulin preparations may occur, particularly in patients who have been recently diagnosed with diabetes and are relatively insulin-naive. \n3.  [Lipohypertrophy](http://academiclifeinem.com/insulin-pumps-understanding-them-and-complications/lump%20under%20the%20skin%20caused%20by%20accumulation%20of%20extra%20fat%20at%20the%20site%20of%20many%20subcutaneous%20injections%20of%20insulin) and [lipoatrophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoatrophy) are reactions to insulin itself. Lipohypertrophy  is more common, and may reflect local action of insulin, as well as the formation of granulation tissue \\[[Richardson, 2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507228)\\]. Areas of focal lipohypertrophy can be mistaken for an abscess, particularly when associated with scarring. Patients may prefer to place the pump needle in these areas because they can become insensate; however, scarring makes insulin absorption erratic. \n4.  Pump cellulitis is often from Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. This infection is often caused by poor preparation of the pump site before insertion. For reliable patients with mild cellulitis and without systemic symptoms, re-siting the needle after good antiseptic preparation is often enough \\[[Pickup, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16912828)\\]. More severe cases need systemic antibiotics and MRSA testing – as these patients will continue to have indwelling subcutaneous needles in the future. Similarly, insulin pump-related abscesses should be cultured.\n5.  Weirdly enough, tight glucose control itself has been linked to complications. Initiating insulin therapy in patients who are newly diagnosed with diabetes has been linked to temporary bouts of local edema; while generally harmless, there are occasional case reports of patients presenting with anasarca and even frank fluid overload when placed directly on pump therapy \\[[Rothacker, 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23815567)\\].\n\n## INSULIN PUMP PROBLEMS\n\nProblems with the insulin pump  present a much more serious challenge, and can involve any portion of the device. While overt software problems in pumps are extremely rare, it is important to realize that patients may inadvertently select the wrong regimen. Additionally, the batteries can fail, or not be changed in a timely fashion. Tubing can easily kink or crack. Reservoirs can leak or not be replenished on time. Subcutaneous needles can frequently slip out. And while pumps are generally good at alarming if insulin is not being pumped, they may not alarm so long as insulin continues to flow… even if the needle is nowhere near the patient. So be sure to check all sections of the insulin pump.\n\nWhen insulin pumps fail, patients go into hyperglycemic emergencies quickly. The insulins used in pumps are rapid acting and dosed continuously, leaving patients with no depot of insulin if the device fails. Because a malpositioned pump may be noticed several hours late, these patients lack appropriate insulin to compensate for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).\n\n## INTRAPERITONEAL INSULIN PUMPS\n\nBe aware that some patients with particularly brittle diabetes may actually have intraperitoneal pumps. These pumps are inserted into a subcutaneous pocket, like a pacemaker, and deliver extremely concentrated insulin directly into the peritoneal cavity. While implantation makes the pump less likely to kink or become dislodged, these pumps can present with several significant complications common to all implantable devices, such as pocket erosion and hematoma formation, as well as the rare possibility of frank peritonitis \\[[Haveman, 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19048281)\\].\n\nThe coming years are likely to bring major changes in how pumps operate. Closed loop pumps, which include a continuous glucose sensor that is used to drive the basal insulin rate, are likely to become much common \\[[Davis, 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20210562); [Joubert, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22209014)\\]. While still under development, these systems have the potential benefit of avoiding hypoglycemic overshoots and will help patients to work less to manage their insulin therapy. As pumps continue shrinking, many more patients will present with implantable models. Some groups are beginning to investigate injectable assemblies of nanoparticles that can act as a closed-loop insulin delivery system \\[[Gu, 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23638642)\\]. So in a few years, your patient’s insulin pump may not even be a pump at all…\n\n## References\n\n-   [Hoogma, RPLM et al.

In patients with poor CO2 elimination (aka not breathing), this CO2 ends up diffusing into cells – decreasing the intracellular pH.\n-   Do not give bicarbonate during resuscitation codes anymore.\n-   Bicarbonate on its own does not help in hyperkalemia. It may help insulin+glucose and albuterol work.\n-   As long as pH &gt;6.9, bicarbonate is not indicated in DKA.\n-   Bicarbonate in rhabdomyolysis is controversial.

Methanol and ethylene glycol\n\n**Click [here](http://academiclifeinem.com/bicarbonate-completely-useless/) for full ALiEM blogpost**\n\n## CPR\n\nThough we have been giving “amps of bicarbonate” since the 1950s for CPR, we have scant evidence for its effectiveness. In fact…\n\n1.  In animal studies, bicarbonate lowers coronary perfusion pressure and decreases rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest. \\[[Kette, 1991](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1920701)\\]\n2.  12 of 14 animal studies concluded that giving bicarbonate during CPR worsened myocardial performance. The remaining 2 showed no difference. \\[[Levy, 1998](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9700442)\\]\n3.  Only 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) for bicarbonate in CPR in adults has been done. It showed no improvement in the rate of ROSC or mortality. \\[[Dybvik, 1995](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7659873)\\]\n4.  Out of 19 retrospective reviews, 11 showed no benefit and 8 suggested worse outcomes when bicarbonate was given during CPR. \\[[Levy, 1998](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9700442)\\]\n\nNational guidelines no longer recommend bicarbonate during CPR. Neonatal resuscitation guidelines (2000) no longer recommends routine use of bicarbonate as it  “may be detrimental to myocardial or cerebral function”. \\[[Niermeyer, 2000](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10969113)\\] The [2005 AHA guidelines](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16314375) no longer recommend bicarbonate during CPR either.\n\n**Conclusion**: Giving sodium bicarbonate during CPR is not helpful and may even be harmful!\n\n## HYPERKALEMIA\n\nTraditionally bicarbonate was one of the mainstays of treatment used to push potassium intracellularly. According to a [1977 paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24132) involving 14 patients, it seemed to work. However…\n\n1.  In 12 ESRD patients with hyperkalemia, bicarbonate plus IV fluids showed no statistically significant change in serum potassium until 4 hours after administration, which returned to baseline by 7 hours. The decrease averaged 0.7 mmol/L. \\[[Blumberg, 1992](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1552710)\\] \n2.  Non-diabetic ESRD patients received a variety of treatments with potassium measured every 15 minutes over 1 hour. Both bicarbonate and normal saline failed to show a significant decrease in plasma potassium. \\[[Allon, 1996](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8840939)\\]\n3.  8 ESRD patients received either bicarbonate alone, insulin and glucose, or bicarbonate with insulin and glucose. The bicarbonate-only group had no change in serum potassium at 1 hour. The insulin and glucose group had a decrease in potassium levels from 6.3 to 5.7mmol/L. The group that received all three showed a potassium decrease from 6.2 mmol/L to 5.2 mmol/L (p&lt;0.05). They conclude that bicarbonate on its own does not help, but perhaps by increasing the pH, the bicarbonate may potentiate insulin’s abilty to drive potassium intracellularly. \\[[Kim, 1996](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8852501)\\]\n4.  The Cochrane Review (2009) reports that bicarbonate is “controversial.” Some studies demonstrate decreased serum potassium when used with insulin or albuterol, while other studies find no difference. No study demonstrated harm from bicarbonate administration.\n\n**Conclusion:** Though no studies demonstrate harm, the solo administration of bicarbonate does not acutely decrease potassium levels. But it may improve insulin/albuterol action on potassium in acidotic patients.\n\n## DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)\n\nCurrently, the American Diabetic Association (ADA) says bicarbonate “may be considered” in patients with pH &lt; 6.9 in DKA. \n\n1.  A retrospective review compared patients in DKA with pH &lt;7.0 who got bicarbonate+IV fluids+insulin, versus patients who received just IV fluids+insulin. They found no difference in time to pH&gt;7.2, or time to discharge between the two groups. \\[[Duhon, 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23737516)\\]\n2.  A retrospective study of 39 patients with DKA and pH 6.9-7.1 showed no difference in pH, PaCO₂, glucose concentration, potassium level, time to normalization of pH, or time to clearance of urinary ketones with or without bicarbonate. \\[[Viallon, 1999](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10628611)\\]\n3.  Pediatrics: A [retrospective study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9437340) on the treatment of DKA in kids showed no difference between bicarbonate+IV fluids+insulin versus IV fluids+insulin in DKA with severe acidosis. They even had a case in this series with an initial pH of 6.73 who did NOT receive bicarbonate and did well. \n4.  There were no studies on patients with pH&lt;6.9.\n\n**Conclusion:** Bicarbonate shows no advantage for pH&gt;6.9 in DKA patients. It remains unclear if it provides benefit at pH&lt;6.9.\n\n## RHABDOMYOLYSIS\n\nIn rhabdomyolysis animal models, bicarbonate alkalinizes the urine. This, in turn, prevents kidney injury in theory by: \n\n-   decreasing myoglobin precipitation\n-   decreasing tubule injury from decreased redox cycling of myoglobin and lipid peroxidation\n-   decreasing vasoconstriction due to myoglobin\n\nHowever…\n\n1.  A [retrospective study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9101605) showed no difference in mortality between saline versus saline+bicarbonate+mannitol. Flaws in the study included the fact that the study did not include a saline+bicarbonate group (without mannitol). Also starting CK levels were low. And no one actually developed acute kidney injury (AKI).\n2.  A systematic review of 27 articles found no RCT comparing IV fluids with IV fluids + bicarbonate. Eight of the articles found delay to IV fluids increased risk of AKI. They conclude that, “No evidence supported a preferred fluid type”. Final recommendations:\n\n-   Give IV fluids to titrate to an urine output (UOP) of 300 mL/hr,\n-   Give bicarbonate only to correct systemic acidosis, and\n-   Give mannitol only if UOP&lt; 300 mL/hr despite adequate fluid administration. \\[[Scharman, 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23324509)\\]\n\n1.  A [well-known NEJM review](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra0801327) recommends alternating 1L NS with 1L D5W with 100 mmol/L of bicarbonate only if urine pH &lt;6.5. They do not describe the evidence found for this recommendation. They also recommend titrating to UOP of 3 mL/kg (about 200 mL in 70 kg patient).\n2.  An excellent [EBMedicine.net review](http://www.ebmedicine.net/store.php?paction=showProduct&pid=258) recommends bicarbonate if urine pH &lt;6.5 with CK level &gt; 5000 as class III evidence – indicating “it may be acceptable, possibly useful, considered optional or an alternative treatment.”  \n\n**Conclusion:** There is no evidence that bicarbonate is helpful or harmful in rhabdomyolysis.\n\n## References\n\n-   [Homsi E, Barreiro MF, Orlando JM, Higa EM.

Infants ≤ 6 months old on day ≥ 7 of fever without other explanation should undergo lab testing and, if evidence of systemic inflammation is found, an echocardiogram, even if they have no clinical criteria\n2. Check for classic findings\n3. Supplemental lab criteria\n  - Albumin ≤3.0 g/dL\n  - Anemia for age\n  - Elevation of ALT\n  - Platelets after 7 d ≥450,000/mm3\n  - WBC ≥15,000/mm3,\n  - Urine ≥10 WBC/hpf\n4. Can treat before performing echocardiogram.\n5. Echo is considered positive for purposes of this algorithm, if any of 3 conditions met: \n  - z score of LAD or RCA ≥ 2.5\n  - Coronary arteries meet Japanese Ministry of Health criteria for aneurysms, or \n  - ≥ 3 other suggestive features exist, including: perivascular brightness, lack of tapering, decreased LV function, mitral regurgitation, pericardial effusion, or z scores in LAD or RCA of 2–2.5\n6. If echo is positive, treatment should be given to children within 10 d of fever onset and those &gt; day 10 with clinical and lab signs (CRP, ESR) of ongoing inflammation\n7.

However, it does appear that <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> does have a more steady sedation depth not requiring as many subsequent doses.  \n-   More studies needed (it would be great to see a three-armed study comparing <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>, <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span>, and <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> with appropriate and clinically equivalent dosing for each). \n\n**[Click here for full ALiEM blog post](http://academiclifeinem.com/ketofol-is-this-the-game-changer-of-procedural-sedation-analgesia/)**\n\n## KETAMINE BASICS\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/2/5/b646845a-82b5-58eb-b4a2-8ac3f55271f7/640.png)\n\n<span class=\"drug\">Ketamine</span> is a dissociative anesthetic that is a phencyclidine derivative and provides sedation, analgesia, and amnesia. It works by inhibiting catecholamine uptake, which exerts a sympathomimetic effect.\n\n**Typical dose:** 1–2 mg/kg IV or 4–5 mg/kg IM.\n-   **Additional doses:** may be required at increments of 0.5-1 mg/kg. \n\n**Major adverse outcomes:** airway obstruction, hypoxia, apnea, and laryngospasm. \n-   In a meta-analysis, of 8,282 patients, [Green et al (2009)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19201064) stated that the total incidence of these major adverse outcomes was only 3.9%. \n-   Vomiting occurs in about 7 – 26% of patients.\n\n***What about the elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) that we are always hearing about?***\n\n[Drayna et al (2011)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22169582) found minimal, transient elevations of IOP that were not clinically meaningful. \n-   The largest difference from baseline IOP occurred at 15 minutes with an estimated change of only 1.09 mmHg.\n\n## PROPOFOL BASICS\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/2/5/23be4f75-bdb1-5c43-91db-0339460f32d4/640.png)\n\n<span class=\"drug\">Propofol</span> is a lipophilic, ultra short-acting hypnotic agent, which works by potentiating GABA receptors on the neuronal lipid membranes. It does not provide any analgesia, and therefore should not be used as a sole agent for sedation. Note that one of its advantages is its anti-emetic property with a very low incidence of vomiting.\n\n**Typical dosing:** 1-2 mg/kg bolus followed by either a continuous infusion at 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/min or by 0.5 mg/kg boluses every 2 – 3 minutes. \nThe [Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium looked at 49,836 propofol sedation cases](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19201064) and found no instances of death associated with propofol. \n-   CPR was required in 2 cases, aspiration occurred in 4 cases, oxygen desaturation (less than 90% for longer than 30 sec duration) occurred in 716 cases, and central apnea occurred in 143 cases. \n\n## HOW DO YOU MIX KETOFOL?\n\nNo standard dosing regimen established.\n\nMost studies and authors recommend a **1:1 ratio** to provide ease of administration. The medications can be mixed or given sequentially. \n\n**[PEM ED Podcast by Andrew Sloas](http://www.pemed.org/blog/2012/6/1/sedation-and-ketofol.html) on ketofol dosing**\n\n-   **Summary:** <span class=\"drug\">Ketamine</span> comes in a 50 mg/mL concentration, so if you take a 10 mL saline flush and empty 2 mL and draw up 2 mL of <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> you have 100 mg of <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span>. <span class=\"drug\">Propofol</span> comes in a standard 10 mg/mL concentration. So if you fill a 10 mL syringe with this you have 100 mg of propofol. If you mix the two in a new 20 or 30 mL syringe you get 100 mg <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> + 100 mg <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> = 200 mg total. Now every one mL has 10 mg of <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>. Your starting dose of this will be 0.5 mg/kg followed by another 0.5 mg/kg after about 30-60 sec. From then on for maintenance you can use 0.25 mg/kg as needed.\n\n## WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE FOR KETOFOL?\n\n**ROUND 1: KETAMINE VS KETOFOL**\n\n[Shah et al (2010)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20947210) conducted a blinded, randomized trial of 136 pediatric patients (ages 2 – 17 years) that required orthopedic procedures and randomized them to <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> 1 mg/kg versus <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> 1 mg/kg.\n\n**Results:**\n\n-   Median dose of <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> = 1 mg/kg (ketamine group) vs 0.5 mg/kg (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> group) \n-   Median total sedation time = 16 min (<span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span>) vs 13 min (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>). This was not statistically significant. \n-   Median recovery time = 12 min (<span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span>) vs 10 min (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>). This was also not statistically significant. \n-   Number of adverse events = 36% (<span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span>) vs 21% (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>). Much more vomiting in the <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> group (12%) compared to <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> group (2%). \n-   No patients required BVM ventilation or intubation. \n-   Satisfaction scores: Significantly higher in the <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> versus the ketamine group for patients/parents, nurses, and physicians. \n-   Recovery times were not statistically different between both groups, which was thought to be because ketamine 1 mg/kg may have been underdosed. This contrasts prior studies documenting a recovery time of 25-108 min (ketamine) versus 14-15 min (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>)\n\n**Conclusion:**<span class=\"drug\">Ketofol</span> has slightly better median total sedation time and recovery time (although not statistically significant) with far fewer adverse reactions, specifically vomiting. Physician, nursing, and patient/parent satisfaction scores were significantly better with <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>.\n\n**ROUND 2: PROPOFOL VS KETOFOL**\n\n[Andolfatto et al (2012)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22401952) performed a blinded randomized trial of 284 patients over the age of 14 in an ED setting comparing <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> 0.75 mg/kg versus <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> 0.75 mg/kg.\n\n**Results:**\n\n-   Adverse respiratory event (primary outcome) = 32% (<span class=\"drug\">propofol</span>) vs 30% (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>) \n-   Subsequent dosing needed in 65% (<span class=\"drug\">propofol</span>) vs 46% (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>) of patients \n-   Both groups had similar satisfaction scores. \n\n**Important points:**\n\n-   The <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> bolus dose of 0.75 mg/kg was significantly lower than the more universally used 1 mg/kg dose. This may be why the number of patients having respiratory events was so close to the <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> group. \n-   The dosing of <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> was q1 minute, despite the more traditional interval of q3 minutes. This increased dosing frequency may have contributed to the higher incidence of hypoxia and BVM ventilation (25%) than in the literature (8-14%). \n\n**Conclusion:**<span class=\"drug\">Ketofol</span> did not result in a reduced incidence of adverse respiratory events compared to <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span>. There was also no difference in induction time, efficacy, and sedation time. Sedation depth appeared to be better in the <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> group.\n\n## References\n\n-   [P.C.

The area of interest is the pleura visualized between the ribs. There are many accepted scanning approaches, and two commonly used in the ED:\n\n1.  **Three views in each hemithorax:**\n    1.  **Anterior:** 2nd or 3rd interspace at the mid-clavicular line.\n    2.  **Anterolateral:** Anterior and mid- axillary lines along the 3rd to 5th interspace.\n    3.  **Posterolateral:** posterior axillary line, looking into the lower thorax and upper abdominal quadrants at the level of the diaphragm.\n\n2.  **Eight lung zones**, or 4 sections, in each hemithorax \\[Volpicelli\\]:\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jz/1/c/0bbab6d0-14c4-55db-bf56-130ffd1ff5f2/640.png)Figure 1: Transducer positions for the 8 lung zones\n\n## Lung Sliding\n\nThe visceral and parietal pleura appear as a single hyperechoic line deep to the internal intercostal muscle, and in healthy lungs will \"slide\" during the respiratory cycle.\n\nAbsent lung sliding is a ***pathologic finding*** found in pneumothorax, contralateral mainstem bronchus intubation or esophageal intubation (lung pulse present), pleural adhesions, stiff lungs, and pleurodesis.\n\n## A-Lines\n\n-   **Horizontal** reverberation artifacts\n-   Arise from the pleural line, are hyperechoic and parallel to pleural surface at equal intervals.\n-   Seen with normal lung aeration and in some cases of pneumothorax\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jz/1/c/ef6573c5-dc58-531f-a79b-8f186ab76870/640.png)Figure 2: **A-lines **are visualized as hyperechoic, horizontal artifacts at regular intervals deep to the **pleural line.** Note the ribs **(r)** in the near field.\n\n## B-Lines\n\n-   **Vertical** artifacts\n-   Arise from the pleural line, extend off the screen without fading, are hyperechoic and laser-like, move with respiration, and erase the normal A-line pattern.\n-   More than 3 B-lines in an interspace is considered ***pathologic***, although many experts agree that any anterior B-lines are pathologic.\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jz/1/c/38bdb63d-2e52-506f-91d7-b5c9106f885c/640.png)Figure 3: **B-lines **are visualized as hyperechoic vertical artifacts arising from the **pleural line** and extending off the screen without fading, erasing the A-line pattern.\n\n## Comet Tails\n\n-   A normal artifact\n-   **Vertical** artifact that looks like B-lines, but are distinguished from them by their depth of extension. They do NOT extend to the bottom of the screen NOR erase A-Lines.\n\n## Lung Profiles\n\n**Normal Lung:** Lung sliding present at pleural line. A-lines. B-lines may occur postero-laterally, but never more than 3 in a single interspace.\n\n**Pneumothorax**: Absent lung sliding, no B-lines. A-lines are present. A lung point, representing the boundary of the pneumothorax and adjacent inflated lung, may be identified.\n\n**Pneumonia:** Focal area of B-lines, asymmetric compared to contralateral lung. Consolidation with dynamic air bronchograms may be visualized (see below). Lung sliding may be absent due to inflammation causing pleural adherence, or decreased regional ventilation.\n\n**Interstitial Syndromes** (pulmonary edema, ARDS, pneumonitis): Greater than three B-lines in 2 or more interspaces.\n\n**Pleural** **Effusion**: Subpleural collection seen in dependent regions, usually anechoic but may be hypo- or iso-echoic if exudative, and may have hyperechoic septae.\n\n**Consolidation or Atelectasis:** Lung tissue appears as a subpleural tissue-like texture, without lung sliding or air artifacts.\n\n## Pleural Effusion\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jz/1/c/89299867-a08a-55ae-b3c3-6d35bbbd0b19/640.png)Figure 4: **Pleural effusion** visualized as an anechoic fluid collection\n\nlocated cephalad to the (arrows).\n\n## Pneumonia\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jz/1/c/639ce714-ec76-5ebd-90a1-adaa16f34344/640.png)Figure 5: A lobar consolidation located cephalad to the **diaphragm.** The branching, **hyperechoic air bronchograms** define this consolidation.\n\n## Struggling with the Exam?\n\nDo ***not*** move quickly. Hold the probe STILL during the respiratory cycle to see lung sliding and lung artifacts. Compare the same region of each hemithorax sequentially instead of the entire hemithorax at once.\n\n**Can’t decide if there is lung sliding?**\nTo optimize visualization of the pleural line, decrease the depth and decrease the overall gain.\n\n**Can’t see A-lines or B-lines?**\nTurn *off* artifact-reduction settings, or use a lung preset if available. Keep the transducer perpendicular to the patient’s chest in all zones scanned. Use a low-frequency transducer set to its lowest operating frequency.\n\n## Common Errors:\n\n**Unable to identify A-lines:** Remember to turn *off* artifact-reduction settings, or use a lung preset if available. Keep the transducer perpendicular to the patient’s chest in all zones scanned.\n\n**Quantification of B-lines:** A single B-line in dependent interspaces may be a normal finding in a healthy patient, but &gt;3 B-lines in a single interspace indicates lung pathology.\n\n**Absence of lung sliding** is 100% sensitive for pneumothorax, but is ***not specific*** to pneumothorax. Other possibilities may be failure to ventilate, contralateral mainstem intubation, dense consolidation from pneumonia, severe pulmonary fibrosis, or pleural inflammatory changes.\n"},"metacarpal-metatarsal-fractures":{"title":"Metatarsal & Metacarpal Fractures","collection":["orthopedics"],"tags":null,"slug":"metacarpal-metatarsal-fractures","content":"\n# Metatarsal/Metacarpal Fractures\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jx/7/i/bcee9ba9-3292-57a4-9ed5-aaf00e3c5ceb/640.png)\n\n## Metatarsal head\n\n-   Typically operative, unless MCP stable and &lt;

If available, the *ophthalmologic, superficial*, or *small parts* preset should be selected on the machine.\n\n**Pt Position:** With the patient’s eye closed, apply a bio-occlusive dressing (e.g. Tegaderm) over the closed eyelid to serve as a barrier. Apply a generous amount of gel over the dressing.\n\n**Windows:** Visualize the eye in 2 planes:\n\n1.  **Longitudinal:** Commence at the midline of the eye. The directional indicator is oriented towards the vertex of the skull. Stabilize the transducer by resting your hand against the bridge of the patient’s nose or eyebrow, taking care not to apply any more pressure to the globe than is necessary to obtain adequate contact. The transducer should be ‘fanned’ from left to right to visualize the entire globe.\n2.  **Transverse:** Rotate the transducer 90 degrees, with the directional indicator oriented towards the patient’s right, and visualize the globe in a second plane. The transducer should be ‘fanned’ up and down in order to properly visualize all structures of the eye.\n\n**Tip:** The contralateral, or ‘unaffected’ eye may be scanned in an identical manner to compare ocular anatomy.\n\n## Normal Eye\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jz/1/c/7e69cc48-db15-5e57-9fb3-e51e9e0ce495/640.png)Figure 1: Normal eye\n\n-   **Anterior chamber** (a): Located between hyperechoic cornea anteriorly and **iris** posteriorly\n-   **Lens** (L): Biconvex hyperechoic structure posterior to the anterior chamber (a).\n-   **Vitreous chamber** (v): Is hypoechoic and encompasses most of the globe and the **retina** adheres to its posterior surface\n-   **Optic nerve sheath** (n): Appears as a hypoechoic linear structure deep to the vitreous chamber\n\n## Ocular Pathologies\n\n**Detachments**\n\n-   **Retinal:** Generally remains anchored to the optic disc in most posterior section of the eye; appears as a hyperechoic membrane floating in the vitreous chamber\n-   **Vitreous:** May be difficult to distinguish from a retinal detachment; may have a V-OOshaped appearance, similar to retinal detachment, but is generally less intensely OOhyperechoic and is better visualized with a higher gain setting.\n\n**Hemorrhage:** Retinal vs vitreous often difficult to distinguish from each other. Hemorrhages will look like echogenic opacities in the vitreous chamber.\n\n**Lens dislocation:** Biconvex or round hyperechoic structure (lens) is displaced from its normal position. With eye movement it may appear to move independently of surrounding structures.\n\n**Foreign body:** A hyperechoic object typically located in the vitreous chamber, but may also be embedded into the retina or posterior orbit. Depending on its composition, the foreign body may cause posterior acoustic shadowing, similar to gallstones.\n\n**Globe rupture:** Very abnormal shape.

Echogenic material fills the vitreous chamber.\n\n## Struggling with the Exam?\n\n**Can’t visualize the eye adequately?**\nIncrease the amount of gel on the bioocclusive dressing, as this ‘evens out’ the surface of the eye for the transducer.\n\n**Unsure if there is pathology in the vitreous chamber?**\nIn order to adequately assess the vitreous chamber for detachment or hemorrhage, the eye should be examined with both moderate AND high gain settings. Evaluate in a fixed forward gaze AND while the patient performs extraocular movements (kinetic echography).\n\n**Is it ever unsafe to perform the exam?**\nOcular ultrasound is contraindicated if there are obvious signs of open ocular trauma or globe rupture. Discontinue the examination if there are sonographic findings of globe rupture or retrobulbar hematoma.\n\n## Pearls\n\nApply a generous amount of conducting gel to the closed eyelid/film dressing to optimize image quality.\n\nDo not miss abnormal structures in the normally anechoic vitreous chamber due to inadequate gain settings.\n\n## Limitations\n\nBedside ultrasound is of limited utility for the evaluation of the bony anatomy of the orbit. If fractures of the bony orbits are suspected, a maxillofacial CT is the test of choice.\n\nCT imaging is more sensitive in the detection of radio-opaque foreign bodies, particularly those that have penetrated through the globe.\n"},"open-fractures":{"title":"Open Fractures and Antibiotics","collection":["orthopedics"],"tags":null,"slug":"open-fractures","content":"\n# Open Fractures and Antibiotics\n\n**Gustilo Classification for Open Fractures**\n\n**Type I:** Open fracture with skin wound &lt; 1 cm and clean\n\n**Type II:**  Open fracture skin laceration &gt; 1 cm without extensive soft tissue damage, flaps, or avulsion \n\n**Type III:**  Open fracture with extensive soft tissue injury or traumatic amputation (includes gun shot wounds and farm injuries)\n\n-   IIIA  Adequate tissue coverage\n-   IIIB  Significant soft tissue loss with exposed bone that will require skin graft\n-   IIIC  Associated vascular injury requiring repair for limb preservation \n\n## Level I Recommendations\n\n-   Start systemic antibiotics ASAP and target gram-positive organisms (eg. **first generation cephalosporins**)\n-   Add **antibiotics for gram-negative coverage** for Type III open fractures\n-   Add **high-dose penicillin**, if fecal or potential clostridial contamination (e.g. farm-related injuries)\n-   Fluoroquinolones provide no added benefit compared to the cephalosporin + aminoglycoside combination.

It can be delivered concurrently with curative care. Early identification of patients who are likely to benefit is key.\n\n## Determine if YOUR patient could benefit from Palliative Care consultation.\n\n**STEP 1: Determine if your patient has at least 1 life-limiting illness:**\n\n1.  **Advanced Dementia or CNS Disease** (e.g. CVA, ALS, Parkinson's): assistance needed for most self-care (e.g. ambulation, toileting) and/or minimally verbal\n2.  **Advanced Cancer**: metastatic or locally aggressive disease\n3.  **End Stage Renal Disease**: on dialysis or serum creatinine &gt;6 mg/dL\n4.  **Advanced COPD**: continuous home O2 or chronic dyspnea at rest\n5.  **Advanced Heart Failure**: chronic dyspnea, chest pain, or fatigue with minimal activity or rest\n6.  **End Stage Liver Disease**: history of recurrent ascites, GI bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy\n7.  **Septic Shock**: requires ICU admission AND has significant pre-existing comorbid illness\n8.  **High Chance of Accelerated Death**: provider discretion – e.g.: Hip fracture in age &gt;80, major trauma in elderly (multiple rib fractures, intracranial hemorrhage), advanced AIDS\n\n**STEP 2 (Consultation): Consider a Palliative Care consultation if your patient has at least 1 life-limiting illness (above) AND 1 or more of the following:**\n\n1.  **Frequent visits**: 2 or more ED visits or hospitalizations in the past 6 months\n2.  **Uncontrolled symptoms**: Visit prompted by uncontrolled symptom (e.g. pain, dyspnea, depression, fatigue)\n3.  **Functional decline**: Examples: Loss of mobility, frequent falls, decreased oral intake, skin breakdown\n4.  **Uncertainty/distress**: Caregiver cannot meet long-term needs; Uncertainty or distress about goals-of-care\n5.  **“Surprise” question**: You wouldn’t be surprised if the patient died within 12 months\n\n## Symptom Control: Improve quality of life in the ED\n\n**Symptom**\n\n**Interventions to Consider**\n\nAgitation\n\nHaloperidol\n\nAnxiety\n\nLorazepam or diazepam\n\nDyspnea\n\nSupplemental O2 and/or morphine for comfort\n\nPain\n\nStanding morphine or fentanyl, or use of opioid drips\n"},"paracentesis":{"title":"Paracentesis for Ascites","collection":["gastroenterology"],"tags":null,"slug":"paracentesis","content":"\n# Paracentesis for Ascites\n\n**Bottom line:** OK to do paracentesis without checking coagulation labs\n\n-   2 prospective studies\n-   No instances of significant bleeding despite platelet counts &lt; 50K and INR &gt;1.5\n-   Two cases of minor bleeding\n\n**Bottom line:** Albumin likely not needed in therapeutic paracentensis\n\n-   9 prospective randomized studies\n-   Pooled 806 paracentesis procedures: No difference with plasma expansion with respect to encephalopathy and death. \n\n## Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis Lab Findings\n\n-   Ascites WBC &gt; 500 cells/mm3\n-   Ascites PMN &gt; 250 cells/mm3\n-   Ascites pH &lt; 7.35\n-   Blood-ascites pH gradient &gt; 0.1 \n\n## Ascites fluid analysis to assess for SBP (pooled data)\n\n| **Lab finding**                 | **\\# patients** | **Positive LR** | **Negative LR** |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Ascites WBC &gt; 1000 cells/mm3 | 508             | 9.1             | 0.25            |\n| Ascites WBC &gt; 500 cells/mm3  | 717             | 5.9             | 0.21            |\n| Ascites PMN &gt; 500 cells/mm3  | 1,074           | 10.6            | 0.16            |\n| Ascites PMN &gt; 250 cells/mm3  | 1,058           | 6.4             | 0.2             |\n| Ascites pH &lt; 7.35            | 129             | 9.0             | 0.31            |\n| Blood-Ascites pH gradient       | 129             | 7.1             | 0.30            |\n\n## Bayes Nomogram\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jx/5/m/5758d15a-6f20-5a20-98d1-f908054546ff/640.png)\n\n## References\n\n-   [Wilkerson RG, Sinert R.Evidence-based emergency medicine/rational clinical examination abstract: The use of paracentesis in the assessment of the patient with ascites.

IV loading does achieve quicker therapeutic level (3 hours), so there may still be a risk of seizure for a short time after oral loading.\n\nDrug references say that an oral loading dose (15-20 mg/kg) of <span class=\"drug\">phenytoin</span> should be administered in 3 divided doses given every 2 hours to decrease GI adverse effects and to ensure complete oral absorption. For a 1 gm dose, that would be 400 mg, then 300 mg, then 300 mg administered every 2 hours. However, this would take 4+ hour total administration time. Therefore, consider giving the oral phenytoin load as a single dose. \nWe frequently give 500 mg now and 500 mg more in two hours at discharge.\n\n**Click [here](http://academiclifeinem.com/trick-of-the-trade-rapid-oral-phenytoin-loading-in-the-ed/) for full ALiEM blog post**\n\n## Supporting data for single dose\n\n[Osborn, 1987](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3826809): \n-   A single 18 mg/kg dose of oral <span class=\"drug\">phenytoin</span> capsules or suspension (mean dose, 1.3 g) was given to 44 patients with recent seizures and no detectable serum <span class=\"drug\">phenytoin</span> level. \n-   Mean serum <span class=\"drug\">phenytoin</span> levels after loading for patients receiving capsules were 6.8 mcg/mL at 2 hours, 9.7 mcg/mL at 3-5 hours, 12.3 mcg/mL at 6-10 hours, and 15.1 mcg/mL at 16-24 hours.\n\n[Evens, 1980](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7361796):\n-   A single 900 mg dose of oral <span class=\"drug\">phenytoin</span> sodium was given to 6 healthy men. Total (bound and free) plasma <span class=\"drug\">phenytoin</span> levels were within the therapeutic range (10-20 mcg/mL) for two subjects and close (not less than 8.39 mcg/mL) for the remaining four. \n-   Peak free drug levels were 1.01-1.60 mcg/mL. \n-   Time to reach total and free peak plasma levels was 6-14 hours and 2-10 hours, respectively.\n\n[Ratanakorn, 1997](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9094065):\n-   A single oral <span class=\"drug\">phenytoin</span> dose of 18.7 mg/kg in males and 24.8 mg/kg in females rapidly produced therapeutic concentration (10 mcg/mL) within an average of 2 hours in males and 2.4 hours in females with minimal side-effects.\n\n## References\n\n-   [H.H.

A vascular or vascular access preset has a very high contrast (low dynamic range) & can make it difficult to identify subtle skin and soft tissue findings.\n\n**Looking for abscess?**\nOther structures may be mistaken for abscess including lymph nodes, solid masses, hematoma, deep venous thrombosis, or cyst. Be sure to slide all the way through the structure in 2 planes to define its borders.\n\n**Looking for foreign body?**\nOther hyperechoic structures may be mistaken for a foreign body including tendons, fascia, etc.\n\n**Is the area is too painful to apply a probe?**\nTry a water bath or heap up a generous pile of ultrasound gel to improve image acquisition and decrease the discomfort of the exam.\n\n## Common Errors\n\nBe sure to familiarize yourself with normal anatomy when performing exams to avoid mistaking artifacts and normal structures for pathology.\n\nFine movements and control of probe is necessary for accuracy and to avoid slipping off the area of interest when performing with soft tissue ultrasound. Consider resting the ulnar aspect of your hand or your 5th digit on the patient adjacent to the area of interest in order to maintain appropriate transducer position.\n"},"spinal-epidural-abscess":{"title":"Spinal Epidural Abscess","collection":["infectious disease","ebm"],"tags":null,"slug":"spinal-epidural-abscess","content":"\n# Spinal Epidural Abscess (SEA)\n\n**Classic triad** (back pain + fever + neuro deficits) found in only 2-13% of SEA pts. \\[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15028325),[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21417700)\\]\n\nESR test:\n\n-   If ESR &gt; 20, sensitivity = 90% \\[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15028325)\\].\n-   If ESR &gt; 30, sensitivity = 81% \\[2\\].\n\n**Diagnostic Guideline** ([David et al.

Less clear is the role that troponin should play in addition to ECG in the diagnostic workup, although it seems that this may allow for safe discharge or admission to a regular ward. A normal ECG result has an excellent NPV, in most studies being greater than 95%.

The 61 treatment group patients received tPA 10 mg over one minute followed by the rest of the dose over two hours, followed by lovenox or heparin. The control group received no lytics and the treatment dose of lovenox or heparin.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThere was a decrease in baseline pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) of 22 mmHg in the treatment arm and 8 mm Hg in the control arm at 28 month follow up. This led to an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 41%.\n\nNot bad you say. Well, there was NO statistical improvement in overall mortality. As far as the secondary outcomes, there was no major bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage in either group and the hospital length of stay was also shortened in the treatment group by about 2.7 days.\n\n## PEITHO Trial\n\nThe PEITHO (PEITHO (Pulmonary Embolism THrOmbolysis) study data was just presented at the American College of Cardiology 2013 Scientific Sessions. This is the largest study looking at sub-massive PEs and use of thrombolytics, conducted over 10 years. In this study, sub-massive PE comprised about 15 to 20% of all PEs, and patients were at high risk for death and cardiovascular collapse.\n\nThis was a prospective, multicenter study of just over 1000 patients who were randomized to a FULL, weight-dosed bolus of <span class=\"drug\">tenecteplase</span> plus <span class=\"drug\">heparin</span> (treatment arm) versus just heparin alone (control arm). The primary endpoint evaluated was the combined endpoint of death from any cause and hemodynamic collapse at 7 days.\n\nThe relative risk reduction (RRR) of the primary endpoint was about 56%, but as we are always cautioned about RRR, the actual numbers show primary endpoint rates of 2.6% in the treatment arm and 5.6% in the control arm, which is an ARR of only 3%. Unfortunately, the rate of major bleeding was significantly higher in the treatment arm (6.3%) compared to the control arm (1.5%). \n\n## References\n\n-   [M. Sharifi, C. Bay, L. Skrocki, F.

WBC &gt;12k\n\nGiven that the Kocher clinical criteria and imaging (XR and US) modalities are only moderately helpful, at best, you should use a combination of your history and physical findings, imaging results, and gestalt to help guide your management decisions. Many clinicians err conservatively and perform an arthrocentesis in uncertain cases despite it being a relatively invasive procedure.\n**Click [here](http://academiclifeinem.com/transient-synovitis-vs-septic-arthritis-of-the-hip/) for full ALiEM blogpost**\n**Introduction**\n\nLimping is a common reason for parents to bring their children to emergency departments. It is known that 77% of acute, atraumatic limp is dealt with in the ED, and 20% do not even complain of pain \\[[Fischer, 1999](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10615981)\\]. Our job as physicians is to complete appropriate assessments to not miss any serious pathology. Specifically, differentiating between transient synovitis (TS) and septic arthritis (SA) of the hip can be difficult and frustrating for everyone.\n\nTS is an inflammation of the joint space, classically following a URI, with a benign clinical course. SA is an infectious arthritis associated with poor outcomes with diagnostic delays, including osteonecrosis, growth arrest, and sepsis. Both can both present as an atraumatic, acutely irritable hip with progressive signs of fever, limp, refusal to bear weight, limited range of motion, and abnormal labs. This overlap makes them difficult to differentiate. Although the diagnostic gold standard is to perform an invasive arthrocentesis (positive synovial culture), can we diagnose using clinical criteria alone, such as Kocher’s criteria?\n\n## Kocher's clinical criteria to distinguish between TS and SA\n\n1.  Fever &gt; 38.5C\n2.  Non-weight bearing on affected side\n3.  ESR &gt; 40 mm/hr\n4.  WBC &gt;12k\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/2/a/3c540f11-f2e8-5c2d-82c2-6c64cd326cae/640.png)\n\\[[Kocher, 1999](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10608376); [Jung, 2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12724602); [Kocher, 2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15292409); [Luhmann, 2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15118038); [Caird, 2006](%20http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16757758)\\]\n\nKocher’s clinical criteria is, at best, only OK at helping to differentiate TS from SA.\n\nIt is, however, the most studied criteria that we have. Despite that, there is still inadequate external validation studies (Caird et al study: 0 predictors still has 16.9% chance of SA \\[[Caird, 2006](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16757758)\\]). The criteria are helpful depending on pretest assumptions. So when applied to a HIGH risk group with HIGH prevalence of SA, the predictive value of the algorithm is high \\[[Kocher, 1999](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10608376);[Caird, 2006](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16757758)\\]. And when applied to a LOW risk group with a LOW prevalence of SA, the predictive value of the algorithm is low \\[[Luhmann, 2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15118038)\\].\n\n## American College of Radiology (ACR) and initial imaging modality\n\nPer the[ ACR Appropriateness Criteria](http://www.guideline.gov/content.aspx?id=37914):\n-   *If traumatic mechanism:* XR should be primary imaging modality\n-   *If no trauma and no signs of infection*: XR should be primary imaging modality, and if negative consider US Hip\n-   *If no trauma, possible signs of infection*: US should be primary imaging modality, and if negative consider XR; If both are negative and still concerned for SA, MRI is the next imaging modality of choice\n\n## Role of Ultrasound \n\n*What they did*: \\[[Zamzam; 2006](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17001248)\\]\n-   154 Children (91 boys and 63 girls)\n-   Mean age 4.3 years\n-   Hip pain suspected to be TS vs SA based on clinical and lab findings sent for US\n\n*Primary Outcome:*\n-   Accuracy of US of hip to diagnose SA of hip and differentiate from TS\n\n*Results:*\n-   Use of clinical parameters, lab, and XR: Sens 74%, spec 74%, PPV 76%\n-   Hip US alone: Sens 86.4%, spec 89.7%, PPV 87.9%\n-   8/69 (11.6%) of hip US’s that were negative for SA were ultimately confirmed to have SA\n\n*Conclusions:*\n-   Clinical parameters and XR are only suggestive in diagnosing hip SA. Hip US performs only slightly better diagnostically. Both, however, are UNRELIABLE in definitively differentiating SA from TS.\n-   Hip US can confirm and exclude hip effusion, but can have false negatives, especially early in disease process (&lt;24hours)\n\n## References\n\n-   [S.U.

In the U.S., **alprazolam**, **clonazepam**, **lorazepam**, and **diazepam** are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the outpatient setting.\n\nImportant points on benzodiazepine urine toxicology test:\n\n1.  Most benzodiazepines screens look for **oxazepam**, because **diazepam** and **chlordiazepoxide** both are metabolized to **oxazepam**.\n2.  The test does not specifically look for **alprazolam**, **clonazepam**, **lorazepam** (or many others). Therefore, a negative result does not necessarily rule out use of these agents.\n3.  Benzodiazepines vary in reactivity and potency and can trigger a positive result due to cross-reactivity.\n\n**BOTTOM LINE**\n\nA negative result doesn't rule out benzodiazepine ingestion, and a positive result only guarantees that **oxazepam**, **diazepam**, or **chlordiazepoxide** is present.\n\n## Opioid vs Opiate\n\nThese two terms are often used interchangeably and really shouldn't be.\n\n-   **Opioid:** Broad category name which encompasses opiates, semi-synthetic, and synthetic agents\n-   **Opiate:** Refers to only naturally occurring opioids\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jx/5/m/5844ffb0-588d-565c-a74d-0de93b9cd9f7/640.png)\n-   **Oxycodone**, a semi-synthetic, is similar to **morphine**.\n-   **Methadone**, a synthetic, has a completely unrelated structure.\n\n**LEARNING POINTS**\n1.  Notice the name of the urine drug screen next time you order one. It is opiates (not opioids).\n2.  The test was designed to look for heroin (technically a semi-synthetic) via its metabolite, **6-monacetyl morphine**. It also picks up **morphine** and **codeine**.\n3.  The test does not specifically look for **oxycodone**, **hydromorphone**, **hydrocodone**, etc. They can trigger a positive result due to their structural similarities, but not in every case. Therefore, a negative result doesn't rule out use of these common drugs of abuse.\n4.  Synthetics will never cross-react with the opiate urine drug screen. They are too structurally dissimilar. That's why there is a separate test for methadone.\n\n**BOTTOM LINE**\n\nA negative result doesn't rule out opioid ingestion, and a positive result only guarantees that **heroin, morphine, or codeine** is present.\n\n## References\n\n-   [Standridge JB, Adams SM, Zotos AP.

Causes of hypotension include hypovolemia, impaired vascular tone, impaired pump function, or some combination of these problems.\n\n## Have I optimized volume status and ruled out other diagnoses?\n\nInitial management of the hypotensive patient should target optimizing intravascular volume prior to initiating a vasoactive medication. Vasopressors or inotropes cannot improve malperfusion secondary to isolated hypovolemia (such as hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding or severe dehydration), and use of these agents prior to volume resuscitation can exacerbate existing metabolic derangements. Unrelated conditions that impair preload or cardiac output, including tension pneumothorax and pericardial tamponade, should also be considered prior to initiating vasoactive therapy.\n\n## How can I pharmacologically redirect blood flow to improve the problem?\n\nSelecting an agent for hemodynamic support is analogous to choosing an antibiotic for infection. You are best guided by matching medication activity to the underlying pathology of the illness.\n\n-   **Problem with VASCULAR TONE?** Phenylephrine is the only agent with exclusive activity at α adrenergic receptors, and vasopressin is the only agent with activity at vasopressin receptors. In this sense, these are pure pressor agents and have no direct impact of pump function. Hypotension from isolated loss of vascular tone is uncommon but can be caused by loss of sympathetic tone from spinal cord injury (“neurogenic shock”).\n\n-   **Problem with PUMP FUNCTION?** Hypotension attributable to isolated acute myocardial compromise can be improved with pharmacologic agents that increase inotropy and contractility. This includes any agent with action at β1 , β2 or dopaminergic receptors. <span class=\"drug\">Dobutamine</span> and <span class=\"drug\">isoproterenol</span> are the only agents with exclusive activity at β adrenergic receptors. Generally, these are pure intropes and have no vasoconstrictive properties. Hypotension from isolated pump failure can be caused by acute decompensated heart failure or acute coronary syndrome.\n\n-   **MULTIFACTORIAL problem?** Problems that impact both vascular tone and cardiac function require medications that operate at multiple receptors. These include <span class=\"drug\">epinephrine</span>, <span class=\"drug\">norepinephrine</span> and <span class=\"drug\">dopamine</span>. The physiologic impact of dopamine is dose dependent, with preferential increases in pump function at lower doses. Examples of disorders that impact both pump and tone include anaphylaxis ([see “Dirty Epi” drip](http://academiclifeinem.com/dirtyepi/)) or septic shock.\n\n## Will I be limited by side effects of my pressor choice?\n\nSide effects of vasoactive medications are related both to the direct mechanism of action of the agent, as well as the compensatory mechanisms precipitated by them. Concerning side effects of inotropes include dysrhythmias and increased myocardial oxygen demand, whereas vasopressors can cause undesired limitations in blood flow to the gut and kidneys.\n\n|  Agent               | Primary Receptor                                                                                                    | Primary Impact                    | Potential Side Effect                                 | Prototypical Clinical Scenario                  |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Phenylephrine        | α<sub>1</sub>                                                                                                       | Increased SVR                     | Reflexive decreased HR                                | Neurogenic shock                                |\n| Vasopressin          | V                                                                                                                   | Increased SVR                     | Decreased splanchnic flow                             | Adjunct for septic shock                        |\n| Dobutamine           | β<sub>1</sub>, β<sub>2 </sub>                                                                                       | Increased inotropy                | Transient decreases in SVR (β<sub>2 </sub>agonsim)    | Cardiogenic shock from late-stage heart failure |\n| Dopamine (low-dose)  | D, β<sub>1</sub>                                                                                                    | Increased inotropy and heart rate | Tachydysrhythmias                                     | Cardiogenic shock, particularly if bradycardic  |\n| Epinephrine          | α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2, </sub>β<sub>1</sub>, β<sub>2 </sub>                                                         | Increased SVR and inotropy        | Tachydysrhythmias and decreased splanchnic flow       | Anaphylaxis                                     |\n| Norepinephrine       | <span class=\"aglmd-moreinfo ui-moreinfo\" data-iid=\"53aa252ed35d3ae92e0048f7\">α1, α2, β1&gt;&gt; β2  </span>         | Increased SVR and inotropy        | Decreased splanchnic and renal flow                   | Septic shock                                    |\n| Dopamine (high-dose) | <span class=\"aglmd-moreinfo ui-moreinfo\" data-iid=\"53aa252ed35d3ae92e0048f8\">D, α1, β1&gt;&gt; β2</span><sub></sub> | Increased SVR and inotropy        | Tachydysrhythmias and decreased splanchnic/renal flow | Bradycardic cardiovascular collapse             |\n\n## When choosing between similar agents, does evidence support use of a specific agent over another?\n\nThe majority of evidence comparing pressors head-to-head has been done in patients with septic shock; the largest amount of data has compared high-dose dopamine to norephinephrine. Based on this data, norepinephrine has been associated with lower incidence arrythmias and improved mortality when compared to dopamine.\n\nEpinephrine has been compared with several other regimens both in septic shock and undifferentiated shock. When epinephrine was compared to norepinephrine and dobutamine, all of the agents were equally effective in achieving hemodynamic goals, though epinephrine was associated with increased incidence of tachydysrhythmias and prolonged metabolic derangement when compared to other agents. There was no difference in mortality. Robust data comparing other similar agents in other disease processes are lacking.\n\n## References\n\n-   [Vasu TS, Cavallazzi R, Hirani A, Kaplan G, Leiby B, Marik PE.
