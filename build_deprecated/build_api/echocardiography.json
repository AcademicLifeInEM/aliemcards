Note the small <strong>pericardial effusion</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"signs-of-important-pathology\">Signs of Important Pathology</h2>\n<p><strong>Pericardial effusion</strong>: Anechoic (black) stripe encircling the heart. Pericardial effusion on PSLA will track between descending thoracic aorta and left atrium. Pleural effusion will not.</p>\n<p><strong>Pericardial tamponade:</strong> Pericardial effusion with RV free wall collapse in diastole. IVC should be dilated without respiratory variation in tamponade. RA systolic collapse is an early finding. <strong><em>Tip</em>:</strong> Use M-Mode through mitral valve to help with timing of RV collapse.</p>\n<p><strong>Hypovolemia:</strong> Hyperdynamic heart with left ventricular walls almost touching in systole as seen in the parasternal long axis view.</p>\n<p><strong>Right heart strain:</strong> RV size greater than LV (normal ratio is 0.6:1) when seen in the apical 4-chamber view. Flattened septum in parasternal short axis with a D-shaped LV. Poor RV function (size doesn’t change much from systole to diastole).</p>\n<p><strong>Systolic heart failure:</strong> Poor ventricular squeeze. Mitral valve does not open widely as seen in parasternal long-axis. <strong><em>EPSS</em>:</strong> Using the PSLA measured distance between mitral valve and septum in diastole. Abnormal EPSS &gt;7 mm = poor LV ejection fraction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"struggling-with-the-exam-\">Struggling with the Exam?</h2>\n<p><strong>Can’t find the heart?</strong>\nPlace the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, which brings the heart closest to the chest wall. Lung artifact is common and asking the patient to exhale can improve your image. Try rib interspaces above and below standard locations.</p>\n<p><strong>Rib shadows obstructing view?</strong>\nTry moving the transducer up or down to get between the ribs, then angle the transducer towards the heart once you have a good acoustic window.</p>\n<h2 id=\"common-errors-\">Common Errors:</h2>\n<p>Pleural effusion can be mistaken for pericardial effusion. To differentiate, locate the descending thoracic aorta in the parasternal long-axis view. Pericardial effusions will track superficial to the descending thoracic aorta. Pleural effusions will track deep.</p>\n<p>Non-orthogonal planes can be mistaken for an enlarged right heart or D-sign. Make sure the LV looks round in the PSSA and that the apex is at the top of the screen in the apical windows.</p>\n<p>Anterior fat pad can be mistaken for pericardial effusion, but will have internal echos (not anechoic) and will not spread all the way around the circumference of the heart when imaged in different views.</p>\n"}}
