Try having the patient take a deep breath and hold it.</p>\n<p><strong>Can’t find the CBD?</strong>\nFrom the intercostal window, identify the gallbladder in a short axis. Slowly angle the ultrasound beam towards the patient’s head, passing all the way through the gallbladder and continuing upwards. The CBD will be seen in a long axis, just superficial to the portal vein. Use color Doppler to distinguish the CBD from the hepatic artery and portal vein.</p>\n<p><strong>Rib shadows obstructing view?</strong>\nTry rotating the probe obliquely to mirror the angle of the intercostal space.  If unsuccessful, you can ask the patient to take and hold a deep breath to bring the gallbladder below the ribs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"common-errors-failure-to-\">Common Errors: Failure to…</h2>\n<p>Bowel gas can cause indistinct “dirty” shadowing. Be sure shadows originate from discrete hyperechoic foci (stones) within the gallbladder lumen.</p>\n<p>Edge artifact can cause shadows from the sides of the gallbladder due to refraction.</p>\n<p>Scan all the way through the gallbladder to avoid missing stones in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, common causes of acute biliary colic and cholecystitis. Be thorough!</p>\n<p>Smaller stones can be missed with some portable ultrasound systems. A comprehensive study may be warranted in cases of moderate/high pre-test probability with a normal point-of-care study.</p>\n<p>Polyps within the gallbladder can often be differentiated from gallstones by changing the patient’s position and assessing for movement - polyps should remain stationary and gallstones should move with gravity (unless impacted in the neck).
