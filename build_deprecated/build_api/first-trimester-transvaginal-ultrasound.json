Shown is a <strong>gestational sac</strong> containing a <strong>yolk sac</strong> and within the <strong>endometrium.</strong></p>\n<p>Both of these windows include a complete sweep through the uterus in each direction looking for a gestational sac and yolk sac or fetal pole within the endometrium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interpretation-and-tips\">Interpretation and Tips</h2>\n<p>An IUP for point-of-care purposes is defined as a yolk sac or fetal pole within a gestational sac within the endometrium. This indirectly excludes an ectopic pregnancy in an appropriate clinical setting.</p>\n<p>Consider measuring the distance between the gestational sac and the edge of uterus. If this endomyometrial mantle thickness is &lt;8 mm, then consider the possibility of an interstitial ectopic pregnancy.</p>\n<p>An ectopic pregnancy will occasionally be seen as an extrauterine mass. However, free fluid in a pregnant patient without an IUP should also be considered an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pitfalls\">Pitfalls</h2>\n<p><strong>Inserting the transducer too deeply.</strong> The transducer should be inserted to the cervix, using it as a window. If you continue to push once at the cervix, the transducer will frequently slide into the posterior fornix and only bowel/rectum will be seen.</p>\n<p>Scanning with a full bladder. While the transabdominal approach is enhanced by a full bladder, the patient should empty their bladder prior to transvaginal scanning to improve visualization.</p>\n<p><strong>Calling a gestational sac an IUP.</strong> At least a yolk sac is needed. A pseudogestational sac with an ectopic pregnancy is possible.</p>\n<p>Relying on the quantitative beta-HCG and “discriminatory zone” for decision-making. Over 40% of ectopic pregnancies will have beta-HCG levels below the discriminatory zone.</p>\n<p><strong>Considering an “inconclusive scan” negative for ectopic</strong>. Ectopic pregnancies are almost always ruled-out by finding an IUP. Absence of an extrauterine mass does not exclude ectopic pregnancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure to recognize specific high-risk populations.</strong> Patients undergoing assisted reproductive therapy have a much higher (1-3%) incidence of heterotopic pregnancy. Identification of an IUP does not exclude a co-existing ectopic in this group.</p>\n"}}
