<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Evaluate for gallstones, signs of cholecystitis, dilation of common bile duct (CBD)</p>
<p><strong>Transducer:</strong> Low-frequency curvilinear or phased-array</p>
<p><strong>Windows:</strong> 3 windows, can be preformed in any order. Try alternative windows if initial choice unsuccessful.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Intercostal:</strong> Anatomic landmarks - Right midclavicular line at the level of the xiphoid process. Initial transducer orientation* – transverse with marker towards the patient’s right</li>
<li><strong>Subcostal:</strong> Anatomic landmarks - Right midclavicular line just below the costal margin. Initial transducer orientation* – sagittal with marker towards the patient’s head</li>
<li><strong>Lateral:</strong> Anatomic landmarks - Right mid or anterior axillary line at the level of the xiphoid process. Initial transducer orientation* – sagittal with marker towards the patient’s head</li>
</ol>
<p>*All examinations should include evaluation of the key structures in two orthogonal (perpendicular) planes</p>
<h2 id="normal-reference-measurements">Normal Reference Measurements</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gallbladder wall ≤3 mm</strong> (measure at near-field/superficial wall in longitudinal view)
<strong>Differential Diagnosis if</strong> <strong>&gt;3 mm</strong>: Cholecystitis, heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, renal failure, ascites, acute hepatitis, adenomyomatosis, multiple myeloma</li>
<li><strong>Common bile duct ≤5 mm</strong> (can dilate after cholecystectomy &amp; with advanced age) Should be measured from inner wall to inner wall.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cholelithiasis">Cholelithiasis</h2>
<p>Transducer orientation is transverse with marker towards the patient’s right</p>

<h2 id="acute-cholecystitis">Acute Cholecystitis</h2>
<p><strong>Signs of cholecystitis –</strong> Gallstones, thickened gallbladder wall, pericholecystic fluid, sonographic Murphy’s sign</p>
<p>Transducer orientation is sagittal with marker towards the patient’s head</p>
<p><img src="https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jz/1/c/c7be2f16-5d90-51d4-b50b-885d20a7d0b8/640.png" alt="">Figure 3: Acute cholecystitis.

<h2 id="struggling-with-the-exam-">Struggling with the Exam?</h2>
<p><strong>Can’t find the gallbladder?</strong>
Have the patient sit up and roll onto their left side to improve visualization. Try having the patient take a deep breath and hold it.</p>
<p><strong>Can’t find the CBD?</strong>
From the intercostal window, identify the gallbladder in a short axis. Slowly angle the ultrasound beam towards the patient’s head, passing all the way through the gallbladder and continuing upwards. The CBD will be seen in a long axis, just superficial to the portal vein. Use color Doppler to distinguish the CBD from the hepatic artery and portal vein.</p>
<p><strong>Rib shadows obstructing view?</strong>
Try rotating the probe obliquely to mirror the angle of the intercostal space.  If unsuccessful, you can ask the patient to take and hold a deep breath to bring the gallbladder below the ribs.</p>
<h2 id="common-errors-failure-to-">Common Errors: Failure to…</h2>
<p>Bowel gas can cause indistinct “dirty” shadowing. Be sure shadows originate from discrete hyperechoic foci (stones) within the gallbladder lumen.</p>
<p>Edge artifact can cause shadows from the sides of the gallbladder due to refraction.</p>
<p>Scan all the way through the gallbladder to avoid missing stones in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, common causes of acute biliary colic and cholecystitis. Be thorough!</p>
<p>Smaller stones can be missed with some portable ultrasound systems. A comprehensive study may be warranted in cases of moderate/high pre-test probability with a normal point-of-care study.</p>
<p>Polyps within the gallbladder can often be differentiated from gallstones by changing the patient’s position and assessing for movement - polyps should remain stationary and gallstones should move with gravity (unless impacted in the neck). Additionally, polyps should not create posterior shadowing as is seen with gallstones.</p>
<p>Biliary sludge appears as an echogenic layer of fluid without associated posterior shadowing within the gallbladder.</p>
