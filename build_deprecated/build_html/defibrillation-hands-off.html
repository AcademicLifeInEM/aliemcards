<p><strong>Take Home Points</strong></p>
<p>Pauses in chest compressions are known to be detrimental to survival in cardiac arrest, so much so that the 2010 American Heart Association (AHA) emphasize high-quality compressions while minimizing interruptions. There have been some studies that now advocate for continuous chest compressions during a defibrillation shock. There have been substantial changes to external defibrillation technology including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biphasic shocks with real-time impedance monitoring to reduce peak voltages</li>
<li>Paddles being replaced by adhesive pre-gelled electrodes</li>
<li>Enhancement in ECG filtering permitting rhythm monitoring during chest compressions.  </li>
</ul>
<p>So the mantra of “hard and fast” may be true when it comes to CPR, but the real question now becomes, should we be continuing CPR during defibrillation?</p>
<p><strong>Currently, there is not sufficient evidence to perform hands-on defibrillation, but do agree that minimizing peri-shock pauses in CPR is a must.</strong></p>

<li>It has been well documented in several swine models that coronary perfusion pressure decreases with interruptions in chest compressions.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it takes several minutes of chest compressions to build up to an adequate coronary perfusion pressure.</li>

<ul>
<li>100 patients with cardiac arrest</li>
<li>Only patients with maximal CPPs of 15 mm Hg or more had ROSC</li>
<li>A CPP &gt; 15 mm Hg did not guarantee ROSC</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Increased CPP correlates with increase chance of ROSC</li>

<ul>
<li>815 patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)</li>
<li>Pre-shock chest compression <strong>pause ≥ 20 seconds</strong> had <strong>OR 0.47</strong> for survival vs pauses &lt; 10 seconds</li>
<li>Pre-shock chest compression <strong>pause ≥ 40 seconds</strong> had <strong>OR 0.54</strong> for survival vs pauses &lt; 20 seconds</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Longer periods of pre- and peri-shock pauses independently are associated with decrease chance of survival</li>
</ul>
<p>If continuous, uninterrupted CPR improves coronary perfusion pressure, which in turn increases the likelihood of ROSC, and pre-/peri-shock pauses in CPR negatively affect the likelihood of ROSC, maybe continuous CPR through defibrillation is a good idea.
Well, wait just one second before we draw any final conclusions…</p>

<li>43 hands-on shocks (4 at 100J, 27 at 200J, and 8 at 360J)</li>
<li>None of the shocks were perceptible to the rescuers, who wore polyethylene gloves</li>
<li>11.1% of shocks exceeded the allowable 0.5 mA of current leakage</li>
<li><strong>Authors’ Conclusion:</strong> Uninterrupted CPR during shock delivery is feasible</li>
<li><strong>My thoughts:</strong> Although these were low levels of electricity, just over 1 in 10 rescuers received more than the allowable minimum shock from doing hands-on CPR! I would question the conclusion of this study.</li>

<ul>
<li>4 types of medical gloves tested (chloroprene, latex, nitrile, and vinyl) with external defibrillation</li>
<li>Single glove and double glove both tested</li>
<li><strong>Concerning:</strong> 45% of single gloves and 77% of double gloves allowed at least 0.1 mA of current flow with external defibrillation</li>
<li><strong>Very concerning:</strong> 7.5% of single gloves and 6.2% of  gloves allowed at least 10 mA of current flow with external defibrillation</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Few of the tested gloves limit the current to levels proven to be safe</li>
