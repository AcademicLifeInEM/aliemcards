<p>The <strong>NEXUS definition of &quot;distracting injury&quot;</strong> is too vague, but is as follows:  (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10891516">Hoffman et al., NEJM, 2000)</a></p>
<p>Defined as “a condition thought by the clinician to be producing pain sufficient to distract the patients from a second (neck) injury. Examples may include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A long bone fracture</li>
<li>A visceral injury requiring surgical consultation</li>
<li>A large laceration, degloving injury, or crush injury</li>
<li>Large burns</li>
<li>Any other injury producing acute functional impairment</li>
</ul>
<p>Physicians may also classify any injury as distracting if it is thought to have the potential to impair the patient’s ability to appreciate other injuries</p>
<p>Distracting injury alone accounted for 30% of all radiographic studies ordered for the 818 NEXUS patients</p>
<p>Injuries to the <strong>upper torso</strong> should be considered distracting injuries (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16394912">Heffernan et al., J Trauma, 2005</a>)</p>
<p>Prospective study of blunt trauma patients</p>
<p>Exclusion criteria: patient age &lt; 18 years, prolonged ICU care, non-English speaking </p>
<p>n = 40 patients with cervical spine injury out of 406 patients</p>
<ul>
<li>7 of 40 patients (18%) had no neck pain or tenderness</li>
<li>All 7 patients had upper torso injuries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Severe pain or injuries in the chest</strong> should be considered distracting injuries (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21248650">Konstantinidis et al, J Trauma, 2011</a>) </p>
<p>Prospective study of blunt trauma patients</p>
<p>Exclusion criteria: GCS &lt; 13, intoxication, patient age ≤ 16 years</p>
<p>n =101 patients with a cervical spine injury out of 9,103 blunt trauma patients</p>
<ul>
<li>4 of 101 (4%) patients had no neck pain or tenderness</li>
<li>All 4 patients had rib fractures or severe chest tenderness.</li>
</ul>
