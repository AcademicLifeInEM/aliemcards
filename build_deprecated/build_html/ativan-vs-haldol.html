<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>What single agent best manages violent, agitated patients in the ED, as measured by shortest time to sedation and shortest time to arousal?</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study of 111 violent and agitated patients</li>
<li><span class="drug">Haldol<span> (haloperidol 5 mg IM), <span class="drug">Ativan</span> (lorazepam 2 mg IM), or <span class="drug">Versed</span> (midazolam 5 mg IM)</li>
<li><span class="drug">Versed</span> is a water-soluble benzodiazepine – excellent IM absorption profile</li>
<li>Patients were agitated because of recreational drug use, alcohol use, and prior psychiatric history and divided equally in each of the 3 arms of treatment.</li>
</ul>

<p>There were <strong>no significant differences in vital signs</strong> between groups.</p>
<p>Ativan was stopped after the first 95 patients at interim analysis because of prolonged sedation times.</p>
<p>Patients required “rescue drugs”, which were additional sedation medications at the discretion of attending physician: </p>
<ul>
<li>8 <span class="drug">Haldol</span> patients (19%)</li>
<li>7 <span class="drug">Ativan</span> patients (26%) </li>
<li>7 <span class="drug">Versed</span> patients (17%)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Complications:</strong> 2 patients who received haldol</p>
<ul>
<li>1 had hypotension</li>
<li>1 had transient apnea</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong><span class="drug">versed</span> 5 mg IM</strong> to chemically sedation a severely agitated patients because of its <strong>shorter time to sedation</strong> (18 min) and <strong>arousal</strong> (82 min).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other IM options: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>HAC:</em> <span class="drug">Haldol</span> 5 mg, <span class="drug">Ativan</span> 2 mg, <span class="drug">Cogentin</span> 1 mg IM all in 1 syringe</li>
<li><em>B52:</em> <span class="drug">Haldol</span> 5 mg, <span class="drug">Ativan</span> 2 mg, <span class="drug">Benedryl</span> 50 mg IM</li>
