# Elbow Injuries: Supracondylar Fracture Flexion

![](Image 1)

## Xray Views

Elbow: AP and lateral
Forearm: AP and lateral
 
## Acute Management

Long arm posterior splint in position of comfort

## Follow-up Timing

Type I: Orthopedic follow up in ≤7 days
Displaced fx: Consult orthopedicsurgeon to discuss, because no evidence on best treatment plan for adults and children (closed reduction plus immobilization vs operative)

## Notes
 
Classifications:
   - Type I: Non-displaced
   - Type II: Displaced with intact anterior cortex
   - Type III: Complete displacement (both anterior and posterior cortex)

Flexion type (compared to extension) more likely to need operative repair in children

Complication: Ulnar nerve entrapment and injury 

Less common overall, more common in adults
