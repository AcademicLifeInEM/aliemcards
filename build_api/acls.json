This puts it at roughly a q4 minute dosing (recommended q3-5 minutes).\n-   Don't delay CPR when you recognize a cardiac arrest. That means do this first, and then work on giving oxygen, placing the patient on various monitors, setting up the defibrillator, and establishing IV/IO access. Hence, the C-A-B mnemonic (Circulation before Airway)\n-   Chest compressions should be \"hard and fast\" -- Depth of at least 2 inches and ≥ 100 compressions with a target pCO2 on the end-tidal capnography of ≥10 mm Hg.\n-   Use your mobile phone's timer to help alert you every time when 2 minutes is up.\n\n**Additional reversible causes** (not listed on ACLS AHA guidelines):\n\n-   Hypoglycemia\n-   Trauma\n\n## Patwari Academy video tutorials\n\n-   [ACLS: Airway](http://academiclifeinem.blogspot.com/2012/11/patwari-academy-videos-acls-and-airway.html)\n-   [ACLS: Cardiac arrest](http://academiclifeinem.blogspot.com/2012/12/patwari-academy-videos-acls-parts-4-6.html)\n-   [ACLS: Bradycardia and tachycardia](http://academiclifeinem.blogspot.com/2012/12/patwari-academy-videos-acls-parts-7-10.html)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n## References\n\n-   [Neumar RW, et al.
