Observational study with >700 patients admitted with influenza showed that oseltamivir reduced mortality (hazard ratio=0.27) and earlier hospital discharge (hazard ratio=1.28).\n2.  Give antiviral treatment ASAP for outpatients with confirmed or suspected influenza who are at high risk for complications (see list above). Use clinical judgement.\n3.  **<span class=\"drug\">Oseltamivir</span>** may be used for treatment or chemoprophylaxis for infants &lt;1 year old.\n4.  Consider giving antiviral treatment for confirmed or suspected influenza WITHOUT risk factors for severe illness, if treatment can be started ≤ 48 hours of illness onset. Can reduce duration of uncomplicated influenza A and B illness by 1 day.\n5.  Clinicians should monitor local antiviral resistance surveillance data because resistance patterns may change over time.\n\n## References\n\n-   [Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.
