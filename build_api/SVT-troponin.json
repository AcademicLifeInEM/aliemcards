A more appropriate approach based on the evidence should be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Low risk, prior SVT, feels good after conversion, then NO CARDIAC ENZYMES and outpatient f/u</li>\n<li>Intermediate risk, then DO get CARDIAC ENZYMES; If neg, outpatient follow up but if positive consider admission.</li>\n<li>High risk, older age, or known history of ACS, then DO CARDIAC ENZYMES and admit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>More than one third of patients will have chest pain associated with SVT causing providers to order troponins and other cardiac enzymes. Elevated troponins are not pathognomonic for CAD/ACS and could represent other etiologies such as sepsis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and pulmonary embolism. Also, subsequent coronary angiography is not necessary for risk stratification in all cases. SVT causes a rapid heart rate, which is well documented as a cause for modest troponin elevation secondary to cardiac stretch, poor diastolic perfusion, and/or coronary artery vasospasm.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://academiclifeinem.com/svt-are-troponins-necessary/\">Click here for full ALiEM blog post</a></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"do-elevated-troponins-during-svt-predict-the-presence-of-cad-\">Do elevated troponins during SVT predict the presence of CAD?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>12 – 48% of patients have elevated troponins after SVT [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643248\">Bukkapatnam, 2010</a>; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17562784\">Dorenkamp, 2007</a>]</li>\n<li>Having a known history of CAD is more likely to lead to troponin elevation than not having a history of CAD (62% vs 43%) [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643248\">Bukkapatnam, 2010</a>]</li>\n<li>There is no difference in the diagnosis of CAD compared to patients with negative troponins  [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643248\">Bukkapatnam, 2010</a>]</li>\n<li>And if that is not enough, here are 6 studies looking at patients with SVT followed by cardiac angiography.</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Author and Date  </strong></th>\n<th><strong>Study Type</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Key Results (Angiography)</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Kanjwal et al (2008)</td>\n<td>Case Series (7 patients)</td>\n<td>All with NORMAL coronary arteries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Miranda et al (2006)</td>\n<td>Case Study</td>\n<td>NORMAL coronary arteries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Yeo et al (2006)</td>\n<td>Case series (3 patients)</td>\n<td>All with NORMAL coronary arteries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Redfearn et al (2005)</td>\n<td>Retrospective Cohort (3 patients)</td>\n<td>All with NORMAL coronary arteries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Zellweger et al (2003)</td>\n<td>Case Series (4 patients)</td>\n<td>2 patients with NORMAL coronary arteries on angiography and 2 patients with normal myocardial perfusion scans</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bakshi et al (2002)</td>\n<td>Prospective Cohort (3 patients)</td>\n<td>All with NORMAL coronary arteries</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Table modified from <a href=\"http://bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1884\">Carley S et al Best BETs 2005</a>\n<strong>Major Limitations:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Few patients (21 patients total)</li>\n<li>Average age of patients between 40 – 45 (Younger patient population)</li>\n<li>Fewer ACS risk factors in these patients (Less likely to have CAD/ACS)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Elevated troponins in younger patients with minimal risk factors for CAD/ACS in the setting of SVT do <strong>NOT</strong> predict CAD  </p>\n<h2 id=\"does-an-elevated-troponin-with-svt-have-any-clinical-prognostic-significance-\">Does an elevated troponin with SVT have any clinical prognostic significance?</h2>\n<p>[<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20453600\">Chow, 2010</a>]</p>\n<p>In general, compared to the prior studies, patients in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20453600\">this study</a> were older and had more comorbidities.
