Is there an ABSENCE of RS complex in all precordial leads (V1-V6?)\n\n-   **YES:** VT diagnosis (Sensitivity 21%, Specificity 100%)\n-   **NO:** Move to Question 2\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/h/cec8b08c-bfdc-5edb-9bf5-d54f3f2545de/640.png)\n\n## 2. Is the R to S interval &gt; 100 msec (2.5 boxes) in one precordial lead?\n\n-   **YES:** VT diagnosis (Sensitivity 66%, Specificity 98%)\n-   **NO:** Move to Question 3\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/h/0274755b-7bc6-55da-b1ef-c6fd69c77762/640.png)\n\n## 3. Is there Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation?\n\n-   **YES:** VT diagnosis (Sensitivity 82%, Specificity 98%)\n-   **NO: **Move to Question 4\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/h/ff0b07a6-637a-53d9-ab63-3c34313c77d6/640.png)\n\n## 4. Is there morphology criteria for VT?\n\nDetermine if you have a LBBB morphology (dominant S wave in V1) or a RBBB morphology (dominant R wave in V1) then use the appropriate section below to help differentiate. Is there morphology criteria for VT?\n\n-   **YES:** VT diagnosis (Sensitivity 98.7%, Specificity 96.5%)\n-   **NO:** SVT with aberrance (Sensitivity 96.5%, Specificity 98.7%)\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/1/h/df1d288d-3788-5847-92b7-f757568d7ba9/640.png)\n\n## Dr. Stephen Smith's Expert Review\n\n Verekei has subsequently published 2 criteria which are much easier to apply and performed better than the Brugada criteria: \n\n This one, which is still a bit complex: <http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/5/589.full> \n\n AND a second one which uses aVR only: <http://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271%2807%2900943-5/abstract>.\n\nI have a post on differentiating VT and SVT with aberrancy using the Sasaki rule, which has not been validated either, but is even simpler than either Vereckei rule.  I use it as a final step if I don’t have the diagnosis from 6 earlier steps.  Of course, the diagnosis is not nearly as important as the management, which is easily accomplished by electrical cardioversion.\n\n<http://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.com/2011/10/wide-complex-tachycardia-ventricular.html> \n\n## References\n\n-   [Brugada P et al.
