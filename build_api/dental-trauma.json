Handle by crown only to avoid damage of periodontal ligament.\n2.  Gently rise tooth with saline, but do not wipe root and ligament.\n3.  Replace tooth and ask patient to bite on gauze (if not at aspiration risk)\n4.  If unable to place in transport medium: Hank's balance solution, saline, milk\n\nID all fracture fragments: May have been aspirated, lodged in mucosal tissue, intruded into alveolar bone\nConsider radiographs: CXR, Panorex\nComplicated fractures/avulsions may require Td and Abx (Pen V, clindamycin)\nVideos from [thedentalbox.com](http://thedentalbox.com/videos.html)\n\n## Fractures\n\n**Ellis Class I**\n\n-   Through enamel\n-   Pulp necrosis risk = 0-3%\n-   Tx: smooth sharp edges with emery board if causing pain \n-   F/U with dentist PRN\n\n**Ellis Class II**\n\n-   Through enamel and dentin (yellow/pink appearance) \n-   Pulp necrosis risk = 1-7%\n-   Painful and temperature sensitive\n-   Tx: Cover tooth with CaOH (eg. Dycal®) after drying tooth with gauze \n-   Tx: Soft food diet\n-   F/U with Dentist 24-48 hrs.\n\n**Ellis Class III** \n\n-   Involving pulp (pink appearance, blood often visible) \n-   Pulp necrosis risk = 10-30%\n-   Severe pain, temperature sensitive\n-   Tx: Dental emergency - contact on call Dentist (If not immediatelyavailable, same Tx as Ellis II except liquid diet)\n\n**Alveolar Fracture**\n\n-   Fx of underlying alveolar bone with tooth involvement\n-   Associated with high impact trauma\n-   ED goal: Diagnose and preserve tissue, repair mucosal tissue \n-   Tx: Dental emergency - contact on call dentist/oral surgeon \n\n## Avulsion\n\nTooth is complete displaced from periodontal ligament\nTx: Dental emergency - contact on call Dentist\nIf PRIMAY DENTITION, do not replace because of risk of ankylosis. F/U with dentist in 1-2 weeks.\nIf ADULT DENTITION, \"time is tooth\" - Periodontal ligament necrosis in 60-90 minutes if not in transport medium, loss of viability\n-   Suction socket with Frasier tip suction --&gt; irrigate with saline --&gt; implant tooth using firm pressure\n-   Splint (eg. Coe-Pak): apply as a bridge to teeth and gingiva\n\n## References\n\n-   [Benko, K. Acute Dental Emergencies in EM.
