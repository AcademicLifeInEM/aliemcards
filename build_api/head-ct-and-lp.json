This does not apply to those being worked up for subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\nIf **ZERO** high risk features, it is safe to do LP without a Head CT:\n\n| **High risk features associated with abnormal CT:**        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Age ≥ 60 yr                                                |\n| Immunocompromise (HIV, transplant, immunosuppression)      |\n| History of CNS disease (mass lesion, CVA, focal infection) |\n| Seizure &lt; 1 wk prior to arrival                         |\n| Altered level of consciousness                             |\n| Unable to answer 2 questions correctly                     |\n| Unable to follow 2 commands correctly                      |\n| Gaze palsy                                                 |\n| Abnormal visual fields                                     |\n| Facial palsy                                               |\n| Arm or leg drift                                           |\n| Abnormal language / speech                                 |\n\n**Study specifics by Hasbun et al.**\n\n**([Hasbun et al. NEMJ, 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11742046))**\n\n**Design: **Prospective observational single-site study (n = 301)\n\n**Observed results**: \n\n-   Got a CT (235/301) --&gt; 56/235 (24%) had abnormal CT --&gt; 11/56 had mass effect\n\n**Validation arm: Applying the “high risk” criteria back to the enrollment group:**\n\nGot a CT (235/301) --&gt; 96/235 (41%) had no “high risk” features --&gt; 93/96 (97%) had normal CT --&gt; 3/96 (3%) had 2 non-herniations and 1 mild herniation on CT--&gt; All 3 patients got LP without complications.\n\n**Results tracking saved time:**\n\n-   Time to antibiotics (3.8 hr for CT+ vs 2.9 hr for CT-) \n-   Time to LP (5.3 hr for CT+ vs 3.0 hr for CT-)\n\n**Limitations**\n\n-   Study requires validation on separate population (different from derivation group) \n\n**Conclusion**\n\n-   If no abnormal “high risk” clinical features, you can do LP without a CT for meningitis (NPV = 97%) \n-   Skipping the head CT prior to LP decreases time-to-antibiotics and time-to-LP \n\n## References\n\n-   [Hasbun et al.
