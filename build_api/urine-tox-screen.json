In the U.S., **alprazolam**, **clonazepam**, **lorazepam**, and **diazepam** are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the outpatient setting.\n\nImportant points on benzodiazepine urine toxicology test:\n\n1.  Most benzodiazepines screens look for **oxazepam**, because **diazepam** and **chlordiazepoxide** both are metabolized to **oxazepam**.\n2.  The test does not specifically look for **alprazolam**, **clonazepam**, **lorazepam** (or many others). Therefore, a negative result does not necessarily rule out use of these agents.\n3.  Benzodiazepines vary in reactivity and potency and can trigger a positive result due to cross-reactivity.\n\n**BOTTOM LINE**\n\nA negative result doesn't rule out benzodiazepine ingestion, and a positive result only guarantees that **oxazepam**, **diazepam**, or **chlordiazepoxide** is present.\n\n## Opioid vs Opiate\n\nThese two terms are often used interchangeably and really shouldn't be.\n\n-   **Opioid:** Broad category name which encompasses opiates, semi-synthetic, and synthetic agents\n-   **Opiate:** Refers to only naturally occurring opioids\n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jx/5/m/5844ffb0-588d-565c-a74d-0de93b9cd9f7/640.png)\n-   **Oxycodone**, a semi-synthetic, is similar to **morphine**.\n-   **Methadone**, a synthetic, has a completely unrelated structure.\n\n**LEARNING POINTS**\n1.  Notice the name of the urine drug screen next time you order one. It is opiates (not opioids).\n2.  The test was designed to look for heroin (technically a semi-synthetic) via its metabolite, **6-monacetyl morphine**. It also picks up **morphine** and **codeine**.\n3.  The test does not specifically look for **oxycodone**, **hydromorphone**, **hydrocodone**, etc. They can trigger a positive result due to their structural similarities, but not in every case. Therefore, a negative result doesn't rule out use of these common drugs of abuse.\n4.  Synthetics will never cross-react with the opiate urine drug screen. They are too structurally dissimilar. That's why there is a separate test for methadone.\n\n**BOTTOM LINE**\n\nA negative result doesn't rule out opioid ingestion, and a positive result only guarantees that **heroin, morphine, or codeine** is present.\n\n## References\n\n-   [Standridge JB, Adams SM, Zotos AP.
