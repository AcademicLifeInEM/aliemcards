Examples may include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n-   A long bone fracture\n-   A visceral injury requiring surgical consultation\n-   A large laceration, degloving injury, or crush injury\n-   Large burns\n-   Any other injury producing acute functional impairment\n\nPhysicians may also classify any injury as distracting if it is thought to have the potential to impair the patient’s ability to appreciate other injuries\n\nDistracting injury alone accounted for 30% of all radiographic studies ordered for the 818 NEXUS patients\n\nInjuries to the **upper torso** should be considered distracting injuries ([Heffernan et al., J Trauma, 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16394912))\n\nProspective study of blunt trauma patients\n\nExclusion criteria: patient age &lt; 18 years, prolonged ICU care, non-English speaking \n\nn = 40 patients with cervical spine injury out of 406 patients\n\n-    7 of 40 patients (18%) had no neck pain or tenderness\n-    All 7 patients had upper torso injuries.\n\n**Severe pain or injuries in the chest** should be considered distracting injuries ([Konstantinidis et al, J Trauma, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21248650)) \n\nProspective study of blunt trauma patients\n\nExclusion criteria: GCS &lt; 13, intoxication, patient age ≤ 16 years\n\nn =101 patients with a cervical spine injury out of 9,103 blunt trauma patients\n\n-    4 of 101 (4%) patients had no neck pain or tenderness\n-   All 4 patients had rib fractures or severe chest tenderness.\n\n## References\n\n-   [Konstantinidis A, Plurad D, Barmparas G, Inaba K, Lam L, Bukur M, Branco BC, Demetriades D.The presence of nonthoracic distracting injuries does not affect the initial clinical examination of the cervical spine in evaluable blunt trauma patients: a prospective observational study.J Trauma. 2011 Sep;71(3):528-32. doi: 10.1097/TA.0b013e3181f8a8e0.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21248650)\n-   [Hoffman JR, Mower WR, Wolfson AB, Todd KH, Zucker MI.
