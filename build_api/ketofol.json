It does not provide any analgesia, and therefore should not be used as a sole agent for sedation. Note that one of its advantages is its anti-emetic property with a very low incidence of vomiting.</p>\n<p><strong>Typical dosing:</strong> 1-2 mg/kg bolus followed by either a continuous infusion at 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/min or by 0.5 mg/kg boluses every 2 – 3 minutes. \nThe <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19201064\">Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium looked at 49,836 propofol sedation cases</a> and found no instances of death associated with propofol. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>CPR was required in 2 cases, aspiration occurred in 4 cases, oxygen desaturation (less than 90% for longer than 30 sec duration) occurred in 716 cases, and central apnea occurred in 143 cases. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-you-mix-ketofol-\">HOW DO YOU MIX KETOFOL?</h2>\n<p>No standard dosing regimen established.</p>\n<p>Most studies and authors recommend a <strong>1:1 ratio</strong> to provide ease of administration.

So if you fill a 10 mL syringe with this you have 100 mg of propofol. If you mix the two in a new 20 or 30 mL syringe you get 100 mg <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> + 100 mg <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> = 200 mg total. Now every one mL has 10 mg of <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>. Your starting dose of this will be 0.5 mg/kg followed by another 0.5 mg/kg after about 30-60 sec. From then on for maintenance you can use 0.25 mg/kg as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-evidence-for-ketofol-\">WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE FOR KETOFOL?</h2>\n<p><strong>ROUND 1: KETAMINE VS KETOFOL</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20947210\">Shah et al (2010)</a> conducted a blinded, randomized trial of 136 pediatric patients (ages 2 – 17 years) that required orthopedic procedures and randomized them to <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> 1 mg/kg versus <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> 1 mg/kg.</p>\n<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Median dose of <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> = 1 mg/kg (ketamine group) vs 0.5 mg/kg (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> group) </li>\n<li>Median total sedation time = 16 min (<span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span>) vs 13 min (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>). This was not statistically significant. </li>\n<li>Median recovery time = 12 min (<span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span>) vs 10 min (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>). This was also not statistically significant. </li>\n<li>Number of adverse events = 36% (<span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span>) vs 21% (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>). Much more vomiting in the <span class=\"drug\">ketamine</span> group (12%) compared to <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> group (2%). </li>\n<li>No patients required BVM ventilation or intubation. </li>\n<li>Satisfaction scores: Significantly higher in the <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> versus the ketamine group for patients/parents, nurses, and physicians. </li>\n<li>Recovery times were not statistically different between both groups, which was thought to be because ketamine 1 mg/kg may have been underdosed. This contrasts prior studies documenting a recovery time of 25-108 min (ketamine) versus 14-15 min (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><span class=\"drug\">Ketofol</span> has slightly better median total sedation time and recovery time (although not statistically significant) with far fewer adverse reactions, specifically vomiting. Physician, nursing, and patient/parent satisfaction scores were significantly better with <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>ROUND 2: PROPOFOL VS KETOFOL</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22401952\">Andolfatto et al (2012)</a> performed a blinded randomized trial of 284 patients over the age of 14 in an ED setting comparing <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> 0.75 mg/kg versus <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> 0.75 mg/kg.</p>\n<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adverse respiratory event (primary outcome) = 32% (<span class=\"drug\">propofol</span>) vs 30% (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>) </li>\n<li>Subsequent dosing needed in 65% (<span class=\"drug\">propofol</span>) vs 46% (<span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span>) of patients </li>\n<li>Both groups had similar satisfaction scores. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important points:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> bolus dose of 0.75 mg/kg was significantly lower than the more universally used 1 mg/kg dose. This may be why the number of patients having respiratory events was so close to the <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> group. </li>\n<li>The dosing of <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span> was q1 minute, despite the more traditional interval of q3 minutes. This increased dosing frequency may have contributed to the higher incidence of hypoxia and BVM ventilation (25%) than in the literature (8-14%). </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><span class=\"drug\">Ketofol</span> did not result in a reduced incidence of adverse respiratory events compared to <span class=\"drug\">propofol</span>. There was also no difference in induction time, efficacy, and sedation time. Sedation depth appeared to be better in the <span class=\"drug\">ketofol</span> group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22169582\">P.C.
