By managing patients with severe sepsis and septic shock with an \"early goal directed therapy\" approach, there was an absolute risk reduction of 16%. Furthermore, the number needed to treat to save a life was 6 patients.\n\n## UPDATE: Less invasive techniques to track sepsis \n\nIn the original Rivers' trial, they used computerized spectrophotometric catheters to measure continuous central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). However, if this is not available, other non-invasive measurements can be used as proxy for the ScvO2, especially, if you choose not to have a central line.\n\n[JAMA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20179283) published a landmark study showing that lactate clearance of ≥10% over the first 2 hours is \"not a worse measurement\" than ScvO2 ≥ 70%. \n\n**Using serial lactate measurements** and the less invasive model:\n\n-   Fluid resuscitate through peripheral IV access instead of a central line.  \n-   Follow volume status either with a bedside ultrasound or urine output.\n-   Follow venous lactate levels at time 0 and 2 hours. If the lactate clearance is ≥10% over these 2 hours, you should follow the algorithm as if the ScvO2 ≥ 70%. That means no need for immediate transfusion or vasopressor agents.\n\nTo determine if a patient is adequately volume-resuscitated a patient using bedside ultrasound, measure the IVC diameter about 1-2 cm from the right atrium junction.\n\n-   If the IVC diameter ≤ 1.5 cm and has ≥ 50% collapse with inspiration, the patient has a very low CVP.\n-   If the IVC diameter is at least 1.5 cm and has minimal collapse with inspiration, the patient is euvolemic. Move to the next step -- assessing the MAP.\n\n## References\n\n-   [Jones AE, Focht A, Horton JM, Kline JA.
