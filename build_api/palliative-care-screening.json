It can be delivered concurrently with curative care. Early identification of patients who are likely to benefit is key.\n\n## Determine if YOUR patient could benefit from Palliative Care consultation.\n\n**STEP 1: Determine if your patient has at least 1 life-limiting illness:**\n\n1.  **Advanced Dementia or CNS Disease** (e.g. CVA, ALS, Parkinson's): assistance needed for most self-care (e.g. ambulation, toileting) and/or minimally verbal\n2.  **Advanced Cancer**: metastatic or locally aggressive disease\n3.  **End Stage Renal Disease**: on dialysis or serum creatinine &gt;6 mg/dL\n4.  **Advanced COPD**: continuous home O2 or chronic dyspnea at rest\n5.  **Advanced Heart Failure**: chronic dyspnea, chest pain, or fatigue with minimal activity or rest\n6.  **End Stage Liver Disease**: history of recurrent ascites, GI bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy\n7.  **Septic Shock**: requires ICU admission AND has significant pre-existing comorbid illness\n8.  **High Chance of Accelerated Death**: provider discretion – e.g.: Hip fracture in age &gt;80, major trauma in elderly (multiple rib fractures, intracranial hemorrhage), advanced AIDS\n\n**STEP 2 (Consultation): Consider a Palliative Care consultation if your patient has at least 1 life-limiting illness (above) AND 1 or more of the following:**\n\n1.  **Frequent visits**: 2 or more ED visits or hospitalizations in the past 6 months\n2.  **Uncontrolled symptoms**: Visit prompted by uncontrolled symptom (e.g. pain, dyspnea, depression, fatigue)\n3.  **Functional decline**: Examples: Loss of mobility, frequent falls, decreased oral intake, skin breakdown\n4.  **Uncertainty/distress**: Caregiver cannot meet long-term needs; Uncertainty or distress about goals-of-care\n5.  **“Surprise” question**: You wouldn’t be surprised if the patient died within 12 months\n\n## Symptom Control: Improve quality of life in the ED\n\n**Symptom**\n\n**Interventions to Consider**\n\nAgitation\n\nHaloperidol\n\nAnxiety\n\nLorazepam or diazepam\n\nDyspnea\n\nSupplemental O2 and/or morphine for comfort\n\nPain\n\nStanding morphine or fentanyl, or use of opioid drips\n"}}
