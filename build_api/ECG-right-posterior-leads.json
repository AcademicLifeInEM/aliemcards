Hypotension (RV infarcts are extremely preload dependent) \n2.  STE in III is taller than ST elevation in II\n3.  STE in V1\n4.  ST depression (STD) in V2 or V3 relative to V1 \n\n## Posterior EKG leads\n\n**![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jx/5/m/498ff820-6646-55c1-b4a1-2651682a4507/640.png)\n**Posterior EKG leads (V7-V9) are applied by moving V4-V6 to under the left scapula.\n**Purpose:** To detect posterior infarcts\nPosterior AMI often associated with inferior or lateral wall AMI\n**Indications:** \n-   STD in V1-V3, or \n-   R/S amplitude ratio in V1 or V2 is &gt; 1 \n\n![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jx/5/m/8e9df683-3124-5da1-8e5a-0b527e5eb1d7/640.png)\nHints that there is an associated posterior infarct:\n1.  Deep T wave inversion in V1 or V2 (in hyperacute stage) \n2.  Upright T wave waves (in later stage)\n"}}
