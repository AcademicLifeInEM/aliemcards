Levels &gt; 5 mcg/mL are associated with serious toxicity, including lightheadedness, tremors, hallucinations, seizures, and cardiac arrest. \n-   In a study by [Chinn et al (1977)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/319962), a nebulized dose of 400 mg (5.7 mg/kg in a 70 kg patient) produced a plasma level peak of 1.1 mcg/mL, far below the 5 mcg/ml level associated with toxicity. \n-   Application to real-life: Using **5-mL of 4% (40 mg/mL)** topical lidocaine solution via nebulizer will provide a total dose of 200 mg. This is within the range of safe, studied doses, and may provide the anesthetic effect you (and the patient) desires. Even if a second or third neb is needed, lidocaine serum concentrations should remain in the safe range.\n\n**[Click here for full ALiEM blog post](http://academiclifeinem.com/safe-dosing-of-nebulized-lidocaine/)**\n\n**Relationship between rising lidocaine serum concentrations and expected clinical decompensation\n**![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/2/5/6f98f150-8670-530a-9e2a-b95aca56d620/640.png)\n\n**SAFE LIDOCAINE DOSING THRESHOLDS BY OTHER ROUTES**\n\n-   **Intradermal/Subcutaneous:** Max dose is 4.5 mg/kg. When used in combination with epinephrine, this value is increased to 7 mg/kg.\n-   **Intravenous:** The generally recognized maximum dose of IV lidocaine is 3 mg/kg (or 300 mg). However, some references estimate up to 6.4 mg/kg as an acceptable minimum IV toxic dose in humans. \n\n## References\n\n-   [Chinn WM, Zavala DC, Ambre J.
