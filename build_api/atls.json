Specifically ATLS stated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carotid pulse only = SBP 60 – 70 mmHg</li>\n<li>Carotid &amp; Femoral pulse only = SBP 70 – 80 mmHg</li>\n<li>Radial pulse present = SBP &gt;80 mmHg</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There were two studies [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3337405\">Poulton, 1988</a>; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10987771\">Deakin, 2000</a>] that evaluated this paradigm.  Although very small studies, they were done by two different authors, using different methods (BP cuff vs arterial line).  Both came to the same conclusion: <strong>ATLS overestimates SBP based on palpation of radial, femoral, &amp; carotid pulses.</strong> Another way to state this is, if using ATLS guidelines to guestimate BP, we are grossly underestimating the degree of hypovolemia our patients have.</p>\n<p><strong>Click <a href=\"http://academiclifeinem.com/is-atls-wrong-about-palpable-blood-pressure-estimates/\">here</a> for full ALiEM blogpost</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"poulton-1988\">Poulton, 1988</h2>\n<p> [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3337405\">Poulton, 1988</a>] &quot;ATLS Paradigm Fails&quot;</p>\n<p> <strong>What they did:</strong> Manually measured SBP with sphygmomanometer in 20 hypovolemic trauma patients and compared with ATLS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5/20 (25%) pts were correctly predicted by ATLS guidelines</li>\n<li>10/20 (50%) pts had false overestimation of BP by ATLS guidelines</li>\n<li>False overestimation of BP was greatest in pts with lowest BPs</li>\n<li>Mean difference of actual and estimated BP using ATLS was 34 mmHg</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  Radial pulses are often present in severely hypotensive hypovolemic patients, meaning the ATLS paradigm is invalid.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deakin-2000\">Deakin, 2000</h2>\n<p>[<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10987771\">Deakin, 2000</a>] &quot;Accuracy of ATLS guidelines for predicting SBP&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>What they did:</strong> Measured SBP with arterial line in 20 pts with hypovolemic shock and compared to pulses palpated by an observer blinded to BP readings.</p>\n<p><strong>What they found: </strong>The disappearance of pulse always occurred in the following order radial &gt; femoral &gt; carotid pulse.
