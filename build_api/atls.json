There were 4 subgroups:\n-   Group 1: Radial, femoral, and carotid pulses present\n    -   10/12 (83%) had SBP\n-   Group 2: Femoral and carotid pulses only\n    -   10/12 (83%) had SBP\n-   Group 3: Carotid pulse only\n    -   0/4 (0%) had SBP &gt;60 mmHg\n-   Group 4: Radial, femoral, and carotid pulses absent\n    -   2/3 (67%) had SBP\n\n**Conclusion:** ATLS guidelines for assessing SBP are inaccurate and generally overestimate the patient’s SBP. \n\n## References\n\n-   [T.J.
