These may have prolonged duration of effect in patients with marked liver impairment, particularly the drugs with active metabolites such as **<span class=\"drug\">diazepam</span>**, **<span class=\"drug\">clonazepam</span>**, and **<span class=\"drug\">midazolam</span>**. Some practitioners like to take advantage of the longer duration of action and active metabolites. Others prefer to have more predictable kinetics in patients with liver disease and stick with the ‘LOT’ options.\n"}}
