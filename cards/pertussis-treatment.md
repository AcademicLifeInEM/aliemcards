## 1. Immunized

= 2 or more doses of DtaP AND &gt; 2 weeks since last dose.

## 2. Classic sx

Infant:

-   Apnea (with or w/o cough), staccato cough, paroxysms of cough with "whoop," post-tussive vomiting

Child/Adolescent:

-   Persistent dry cough &gt; 2 weeks, paroxysms of cough with/out "whoop," post-tussive vomiting

## 3. High Risk Contacts

-   Age &lt; 3 months OR &lt; 6 months and unimmunized
-   AdultÂ with immunodeficiency REGARDLESS of immunization status
-   Unimmunized pregnant woman in last trimester, OR
-   Health person with close contact with any of above groups

**Note**: Always give DtaP or Tdap if not up to date

**Note**: Decision to give PEP should not consider immunization status or presence/absence of symptoms

## 4. Test for Pertussis

NP swab for culture (more specific) AND PCR (more sensitive)

## 5. Medications for Treatment or Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)

-   Age &lt; 1 month: <span class="drug>Azithromycin</span> 10 mg/kg/day x 5 days
-   Age 1-5 months: <span class="drug>Azithromycin</span> 10 mg/kg/day x 5 days (preferred), OR
    -   <span class=
  "drug>Erythromycin</span>: 40-50 mg/kd/day QID x 14 days
    -   <span class=
  "drug>Clarithromycin</span>: 15 mg/kg/day BID x 7 days
    -   <span class=
  "drug>TMP/SMZ</span>: 8 mg/kg/day of TMP BID x 14 days
-   Age &gt; 5 months: <span class="drug>Azithromycin</span> 10 mg/kg (max 500 mg) on day 1, then 5 mg/kg/day (max 250 mg) days 2-5, OR
-   <span class="drug>Erythromycin</span>: 40-50 mg/kg/day (max 2 g/day) QID x 14 days
-   <span class="drug>Clarithromcin</span>: 15 mg/kg/day (max 1 g/day) BID x 7 days
-   <span class="drug>TMP</span>/SMZ: 8 mg/kg/day of TMP (max 320 mg) BID x 14 days

**Note**: Report all patients treated to Deptartment of Public Health, empirically or test +

**Note**: Daycare/school--Parents and contacts may return after 5 days Abx

**Note**: Timing of tx/PEP--Only effective if started &lt; 6 weeks after symptom onset in age &lt; 1 year, or &lt; 3 weeks after sx onsent in age &gt; 1 yr

## 6. Low Risk Contacts

-   Close contact with symptomatic patient (face-to-face exposure), direct contact with secretions, sharing of enclosed space &gt; 1 hr, AND
-   Does not meet high risk contact criteria

**Note**: Should be given DtaP or tDap if not up to date.
