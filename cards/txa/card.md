# Tranexamic Acid (TXA)

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic form of lysine, an amino acid. It is classified as an "anti-fibrinolytic" which means it is a  pro-coagulant. It binds to receptors on plasmin preventing it from breaking down fibrin clots. Tranexamic acid was originally discovered in 1962 and is currently on the World Health Organization's list of Essential Medicines. 

The drug has been studied in many settings for the prevention or treatment of hemorrhage. The uses most relevant to Emergency Medicine (EM) include traumatic hemorrhage, gynecological hemorrhage, and epistaxis, which are summarized below. However, dosing and references have been included, by specialty, for the other indications that have been studied. Please note that the vast majority of these indications are not currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

# Evidence in Emergency Medicine

## Trauma

### Crash-2 

A randomized control trial, in 274 hospitals, 40 countries, 20,000 patients with all forms of trauma and significant hemorrhage, TXA v. Placebo

IV Loading dose: 1,000 mg over 10 minutes, followed by 1,000 mg over the next 8 hours.

- mortality relative risk reduction of 9% (absolute reduction 1.5%)
- death from hemorrhage relative risk reduction 15% (absolute reduction 0.8%, NNT 125)
- no difference in vascular occlusion (thrombosis) rates.
- if TXA given within 1 hour, relative risk reduction of death from hemorrhage 32% (absolute reduction 2.4%, NNT 41 )
- if TXA given between 1-3 hours, relative risk reduction of death from hemorrhage 21% (absolute reduction 1.25% NNT 80)
- after 3 hours, mortality increased in the TXA group relative risk increased 44% (absolute increase 1.3%, NNH 77)

2015 Cochrane Review (12) reached the same conclusions.

A German pre-hospital study (3) retrospectively evaluated trauma patients administered TXA pre-hospital with a matched cohort. 258 patients each group.

- TXA treatment population received less pRBCs in the ED (not statistically sig., small study)
- 24 hour mortality relative risk reduction 53% (absolute risk reduction 6.6%, NNT 15.1)
- overall hospital mortality was similar. (Small study)

There are numerous studies involving use of TXA in pre-hospital military patients. A 2015 lengthy literature review was published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (4).

## Gynecology

### WOMAN Trial 

A randomized control trial, 193 hospitals, 21 countries, 20,060 women with diagnosis of post-partum hemorrhage after vaginal or c-section birth

- death from hemorrhage, relative risk reduction 21% (absolute risk reduction 0.4%, NNT 250)
- if TXA given within 3 hours of birth, death relative risk reduction 30% (absolute risk reduction 0.5%, NNT 200)
- if TXA given after 3 hours of birth, no change between two groups.
- TXA did not change hysterectomy rate.
- TXA reduced laparotomy to control bleeding, relative risk reduction 39% (absolute risk reduction 0.5%, NNT 200)

### Combined

Hemorrhage and treatment delay effect from the Lancet (17) An analysis of CRASH-2 and WOMAN trials concluded:

- Surgical from bleeding is better with TXA
- Effects dramatically fall in a non-linear fashion, the longer the delay in TXA administration, with no effect between 135-180 min.
- Estimated that treatment benefit decreased by 10% for every 15 minute delay.

## Epistaxis

Epistaxis treatment using injectable form of TXA topically (18).
500 mg in 5 ml of TXA soaked into a cotton pledget was superior to anterior nasal packing.(absolute risk reduction 40%, NNT 2.5).
Small study, 216 patients.

Neurosurgery
Intracranial hemorrhage associated with thrombolytics (plasminogen-activator) (eg, alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase): IV: 10 to 15 mg/kg over 20 minutes (as an alternative to cryoprecipitate); check fibrinogen levels after administration, if fibrinogen <150 mg/dL, cryoprecipitate is recommended (8).

Orthopedics
Total knee arthroplasty (bilateral), perioperative blood loss reduction:
Three-dose regimen: 10 mg/kg administered as a slow IV infusion 30 minutes before tourniquet deflation for the first operation, 30 minutes before tourniquet deflation for the second operation, and 3 hours after commencement of the second dose (11).
Two-dose regimen: 10 or 15 mg/kg administered over 10 minutes before deflation of the first tourniquet, with the second dose administered 3 hours after the first dose (MacGillivray 2011).

AR (absolute risk) = the number of events (good or bad) in treated or control groups, divided by the number of people in that group
ARC = the AR of events in the control group
ART = the AR of events in the treatment group
ARR (absolute risk reduction) = ARC – ART
RR (relative risk) = ART / ARC
RRR (relative risk reduction) = (ARC – ART) / ARC
RRR = 1 – RR
NNT (number needed to treat) = 1 / ARR
