# Tranexamic Acid (TXA)

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic form of lysine, an amino acid. It binds to receptors on plasmin preventing it from breaking down fibrin clots. The drug has been studied in many settings for the prevention or treatment of hemorrhage. The uses most relevant to emergency medicine (EM) include traumatic hemorrhage, gynecological hemorrhage, and epistaxis, summarized below. 

Please note that the vast majority of these indications are not currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

## Dosing

### FDA Approved

**Menorrhagia**: brandname Lysteda, 1,300 mg PO TID during menses, max 5 days

### Off Label Dosing

**ENT**

- Epistaxis treatment using injectable form of TXA topically [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23911102)
- 500 mg in 5 ml of TXA soaked into a cotton pledget was superior to anterior nasal packing
- Absolute risk reduction 40%, NNT 2.5
- Small study, only 216 patients

**OB/Gyn**

- Postpartum hemorrhage: 1,000 mg IV over 10 minutes given within 3 hours of vaginal birth or cesarean section
- If bleeding continues after 30 minutes or restarts within 24 hours after the first dose, a second dose of 1,000 mg may be given [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5446563/).

**Trauma**

- Trauma-associated hemorrhage: IV Loading dose 1,000 mg over 10 minutes, followed by 1,000 mg over the next 8 hours [[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20554319).

## Evidence

### Trauma

**Crash-2** [[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20554319)
Randomized control trial, 274 hospitals, 40 countries, 20,000 patients with all forms of trauma and significant hemorrhage, TXA v. placebo.

- Mortality relative risk reduction of 9% (absolute reduction 1.5%)
- Death from hemorrhage relative risk reduction 15% (absolute reduction 0.8%, NNT 125)
- No difference in vascular occlusion (thrombosis) rates
- IV Loading dose: 1,000 mg over 10 minutes, followed by 1,000 mg over the next 8 hours

Analysis of Crash-2 data [[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=21439633)

- If TXA given within 1 hour, relative risk reduction of death from hemorrhage 32% (absolute reduction 2.4%, NNT 41)
- If TXA given between 1-3 hours, relative risk reduction of death from hemorrhage 21% (absolute reduction 1.25% NNT 80)
- After 3 hours, mortality increased in the TXA group relative risk increased 44% (absolute increase 1.3%, NNH 77)

2015 Cochrane Review reached the same conclusions [[5]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25956410).

A German pre-hospital study retrospectively evaluated trauma patients administered TXA pre-hospital with a matched cohort [[6]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=27176727).

- 258 patients each group
- TXA treatment population received less pRBCs in the ED (not statistically significant)
- 24 hour mortality relative risk reduction 53% (absolute risk reduction 6.6%, NNT 15.1)
- However, overall hospital mortality was similar
- Small study

2015 lengthy literature review was published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery reviewing use of TXA in the prehospital setting [[7]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=26002268).

- 129 RCTs and one meta-analysis reviewed
- Concluded: “High-level evidence supports its use in trauma and strongly suggests that its implementation in the prehospital setting offers a survival advantage to many patients, particularly when evacuation to surgical care may be delayed.”

### Gynecology

**WOMAN Trial** [[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5446563/)
Randomized control trial, 193 hospitals, 21 countries, 20,060 women with diagnosis of post-partum hemorrhage after vaginal or c-section birth.

- Death from hemorrhage, relative risk reduction 21% (absolute risk reduction 0.4%, NNT 250)
- If TXA given within 3 hours of birth, death relative risk reduction 30% (absolute risk reduction 0.5%, NNT 200)
- If TXA given after 3 hours of birth, no change between two groups
- TXA did not change hysterectomy rate
- TXA reduced laparotomy to control bleeding, relative risk reduction 39% (absolute risk reduction 0.5%, NNT 200)

### Combined Trauma & Gyn

Hemorrhage and treatment delay effect from the Lancet [[8]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5773762/): An analysis of CRASH-2 and WOMAN trials concluded:

- Survival from bleeding is better with TXA
- Effects fall dramatically in a non-linear fashion, the longer the delay in TXA administration. No effect between 135-180 min.
- Estimated that treatment benefit decreased by 10% for every 15 minute delay

### Epistaxis

Epistaxis treatment using injectable form of TXA topically [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23911102)

- 500 mg in 5 ml of TXA soaked into a cotton pledget was superior to anterior nasal packing (absolute risk reduction 40%, NNT 2.5)
- Small study, only 216 patients
