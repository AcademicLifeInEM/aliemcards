# Tranexamic Acid (TXA)

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic form of lysine, an amino acid. It is classified as an "anti-fibrinolytic" which means it is a  pro-coagulant. It binds to receptors on plasmin preventing it from breaking down fibrin clots. Tranexamic acid was originally discovered in 1962 and is currently on the World Health Organization's list of Essential Medicines. 

The drug has been studied in many settings for the prevention or treatment of hemorrhage. The uses most relevant to Emergency Medicine (EM) include traumatic hemorrhage, gynecological hemorrhage, and epistaxis, which are summarized below. However, dosing and references have been included, by specialty, for the other indications that have been studied. Please note that the vast majority of these indications are not currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

# Evidence in Emergency Medicine

## Trauma

### CRASH-2 

[CRASH-2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20554319) was a randomized control trial, in 274 hospitals, 40 countries, 20,000 patients with all forms of trauma and significant hemorrhage, TXA v. Placebo

IV Loading dose: 1,000 mg over 10 minutes, followed by 1,000 mg over the next 8 hours.

- mortality relative risk reduction of 9% (absolute reduction 1.5%)
- death from hemorrhage relative risk reduction 15% (absolute reduction 0.8%, NNT 125)
- no difference in vascular occlusion (thrombosis) rates.
- if TXA given within 1 hour, relative risk reduction of death from hemorrhage 32% (absolute reduction 2.4%, NNT 41 )
- if TXA given between 1-3 hours, relative risk reduction of death from hemorrhage 21% (absolute reduction 1.25% NNT 80)
- after 3 hours, mortality increased in the TXA group relative risk increased 44% (absolute increase 1.3%, NNH 77)

[2015 Cochrane Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25956410) reached the same conclusions.

[A German pre-hospital study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=27176727) retrospectively evaluated trauma patients administered TXA pre-hospital with a matched cohort. 258 patients each group.

- TXA treatment population received less pRBCs in the ED (not statistically sig., small study)
- 24 hour mortality relative risk reduction 53% (absolute risk reduction 6.6%, NNT 15.1)
- overall hospital mortality was similar. (Small study)

There are numerous studies involving use of TXA in pre-hospital military patients. [A 2015 lengthy literature review was published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=26002268).

## Gynecology

### WOMAN Trial 

[WOMAN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20979013) was a randomized control trial, 193 hospitals, 21 countries, 20,060 women with diagnosis of post-partum hemorrhage after vaginal or c-section birth

- death from hemorrhage, relative risk reduction 21% (absolute risk reduction 0.4%, NNT 250)
- if TXA given within 3 hours of birth, death relative risk reduction 30% (absolute risk reduction 0.5%, NNT 200)
- if TXA given after 3 hours of birth, no change between two groups.
- TXA did not change hysterectomy rate.
- TXA reduced laparotomy to control bleeding, relative risk reduction 39% (absolute risk reduction 0.5%, NNT 200)

### Combined

Hemorrhage and treatment delay effect [from the Lancet](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32455-8/fulltext) an analysis of CRASH-2 and WOMAN trials concluded:

- Surgical from bleeding is better with TXA
- Effects dramatically fall in a non-linear fashion, the longer the delay in TXA administration, with no effect between 135-180 min.
- Estimated that treatment benefit decreased by 10% for every 15 minute delay.

## Epistaxis

[A trial using the injectable from of TXA topically](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23911102) for epistaxis

- 500 mg in 5 ml of TXA soaked into a cotton pledget was superior to anterior nasal packing.(absolute risk reduction 40%, NNT 2.5).
- Small study, 216 patients.

## Dosing
