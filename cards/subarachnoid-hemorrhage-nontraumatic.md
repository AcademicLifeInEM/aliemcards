# Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Nontraumatic: High Risk Characteristics

Consider SAH if patient presents with  **at least 1 of the 7  **unique high-risk characteristics, based on the 3 models**:

## Study Details

**Study design**

-   Multicenter (6) prospective cohort study over 5 years

**Inclusion criteria**
-   Neurologically intact adults (age ≥ 16 years) with a non-traumatic headache peaking within an hour

**Exclusion criteria**
-   History of ≥ 3 recurrent HA’s of same character/intensity
-   Referred from another hospital with confirmed SAH
-   Returned for reassessment of same HA which was already evaluated for SAH 
-   Papilledema
-   New focal neurologic deficits
-   Previous diagnosis of cerebral aneurysm or SAH
-   Previous diagnosis of brain neoplasm
-   Known hydrocephalus 

**Outcome measures**

<!-- -->

-   SAH by CT
-   Xanthochromia
-   RBC in LP plus positive angiogram

## Study Results

-   130 of 1999 (6.5%) patients had a SAH
-   1546/1999 (78.5%) of all HA patients said that it was the “worst HA of their life” 
-   <span class="aglmd-moreinfo ui-moreinfo" data-iid="53aa2472d35d3ae92e001503">3 models were associated with SAH with a sensitivity of 100%</span>

**Model 1:** (sensitivity 100%, specificity 28.4%, NPV 100%) 
-   Age ≥ 40 years
-   Neck pain or stiffness
-   Witnessed loss of consciousness  
-   Onset of HA with exertion

**Model 2:** (sensitivity 100%, specificity 36.5%, NPV 100%) 

-   Arrival by ambulance
-   Age ≥ 45 years
-   Vomiting at least once 
-   DBP ≥ 100 mmHg

**Model 3:** (sensitivity 100%, specificity 38.8%, NPV 100%)

-   Arrival by ambulance
-   SBP ≥ 160 mmHg
-   Neck pain or stiffness
-   Age 45-55 years
