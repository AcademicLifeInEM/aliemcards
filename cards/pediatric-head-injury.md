# Pediatric Blunt Head Trauma (PECARN Study)

Fact: Risk of CT-documented TBI in children GCS &lt; 14 = 20% 

Study details
- Derivation (n = 33,785) and validation (n = 8,627) of clinical decision rule for deciding&nbsp;who NOT to get head CT’s for blunt head trauma.
- Enrolled age &lt; 18 yr within 24 hrs of head trauma and GCS 14-15
- Patients from 25 enrolling Emergency Departments&nbsp;

Pre-defined “clinically important traumatic brain injury” (ciTBI) as:

-   Death from TBI
-   Intubation &gt; 24 hours duration
-   Neurosurgical intervention
-   Hospital admission ≥ 2 nights

## PATIENT Age &lt; 2 Years
