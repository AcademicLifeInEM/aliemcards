# Ketamine and Propofol (Ketofol) for Procedural Sedation

**Take Home Points**

- <span class="drug">Ketofol</span> is a combination of <span class="drug">ketamine</span> and <span class="drug">propofol</span>.
- <span class="drug">Ketamine</span> gives you a dissociative sedative, analgesic, and amnestic effect.
- <span class="drug">Propofol</span> gives you rapid sedation and antiemetic effects. 
- Overall, it appears that <span class="drug">ketofol</span> could have a slightly better time to sedation, and length of sedation, but this is not statistically significant based on available evidence. However, it does appear that <span class="drug">ketofol</span> does have a more steady sedation depth not requiring as many subsequent doses.  
- More studies needed (it would be great to see a three-armed study comparing <span class="drug">ketofol</span>, <span class="drug">ketamine</span>, and <span class="drug">propofol</span> with appropriate and clinically equivalent dosing for each). 

## Ketamine Basics

![Ketamine basics table](image-1.png)

<span class="drug">Ketamine</span> is a dissociative anesthetic that is a phencyclidine derivative and provides sedation, analgesia, and amnesia. It works by inhibiting catecholamine uptake, which exerts a sympathomimetic effect.

**Typical dose:** 1–2 mg/kg IV or 4–5 mg/kg IM

- Additional doses may be required at increments of 0.5-1 mg/kg. 

**Major adverse outcomes:** airway obstruction, hypoxia, apnea, and laryngospasm. 

- In a meta-analysis, of 8,282 patients, [Green et al (2009)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19201064) stated that the total incidence of these major adverse outcomes was only 3.9%. 
- Vomiting occurs in about 7–26% of patients.

### What about the elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) that we are always hearing about?

[Drayna et al (2011)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22169582) found minimal, transient elevations of IOP that were not clinically meaningful. 

- The largest difference from baseline IOP occurred at 15 minutes with an estimated change of only 1.09 mmHg.

## Propofol Basics

![Propofol basics table](image-2.png)

<span class="drug">Propofol</span> is a lipophilic, ultra short-acting hypnotic agent, which works by potentiating GABA receptors on the neuronal lipid membranes. It does not provide any analgesia, and therefore should not be used as a sole agent for sedation. Note that one of its advantages is its anti-emetic property with a very low incidence of vomiting.

**Typical dosing:** 1-2 mg/kg bolus followed by either a continuous infusion at 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/min or by 0.5 mg/kg boluses every 2–3 minutes. 
The [Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium looked at 49,836 propofol sedation cases](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19201064) and found no instances of death associated with propofol. 

- CPR was required in 2 cases, aspiration occurred in 4 cases, oxygen desaturation (less than 90% for longer than 30 sec duration) occurred in 716 cases, and central apnea occurred in 143 cases. 

## HOW DO YOU MIX KETOFOL?

No standard dosing regimen established.

Most studies and authors recommend a **1:1 ratio** to provide ease of administration. The medications can be mixed or given sequentially.
