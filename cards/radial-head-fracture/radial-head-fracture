# Elbow Injuries: Radial Head Fracture

![](Image 1)

## Xray Views

Elbow XR: AP, lateral, +/- radiocapitellate view

Assess for indirect signs of fx or DL on lateral elbow view:

   - Sail sign or posterior fat pad; radiocapitellate line misalignment

## Acute Management

Type I: Sling

Type II-IV: Long-arm posterior splint with elbow at 90° flexion (with type IV elbow dislocation reduced)

## Follow-up Timing

Operative indications:
   - >3 mm displacement
   - 33% articular surface involvement
   - Angulated >30°
   - Associated elbow dislocation

Orthopedic follow-up timing:
   - ≤3 days (if operative)
   - <1-2 weeks with early mobilization in 48 hours to minimize elbow stiffness

## Notes

Mason Classification:
   - Type I: Minimally displaced fracture ≤2 mm
   - Type II: Fracture fragment displaced >2 mm or angulated
   - Type III: Comminuted and displaced fracture
   - Type IV: Associated elbow dislocation

Most common elbow fractures in adults
