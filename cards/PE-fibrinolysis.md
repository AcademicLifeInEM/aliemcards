# Fibrinolysis for Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

**Massive PE:** Acute PE with at least 1 of the following:

-   Sustained hypotension from PE itself (SBP &lt; 90 mmHg for ≥ 15 min, or requiring inotropic support)
-   Pulselessness
-   Persistent profound bradycardia (HR &lt; 40 bpm with signs/symptoms of shock)

**Submassive PE:** Acute PE without systemic hypotension (SBP ≥ 90 mmHg) but with either RV dysfunction or myocardial necrosis.

-   *RV dysfunction:* the presence of at least 1 of the following:

    -   Echo: RV dilation (apical 4-chamber RV diameter divided by LV diameter &gt; 0.9), or RV systolic dysfunction
    -   CT: RV dilation (4-chamber RV diameter divided by LV diameter &gt; 0.9)
    -   BNP &gt; 90 pg/mL
    -   N-terminal pro-BNP &gt; 500 pg/mL
    -   ECG changes: New complete or incomplete right BBB, anteroseptal ST elevation or depression, or anteroseptal T-wave inversion
-   *Myocardial necrosis is defined as either of the following*:

    -   Troponin I &gt; 0.4 ng/mL
    -   Troponin T &gt; 0.1 ng/mL

**Low Risk PE**: Acute PE and the absence of clinical markers of adverse prognosis that define massive or submassive PE

## Fibrinolytic dosing

**Alteplase** 100 mg IV over 2 hours.
-   Consider contraindications for Alteplase when deciding to proceed with Rx
-   Currently, only FDA approved agents for PE are urokinase, streptokinase, and alteplase. Tenecteplase studies in progress.
