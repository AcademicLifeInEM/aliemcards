# Benzodiazepine Metabolism by the Liver

**Take Home Point**

- **ALL benzodiazepines are metabolized by the liver. **Some are just metabolized by different pathways that are less dependent on global liver function.
- **The ‘LOT’ drugs are those metabolized mostly by conjugation.**

  -   L – **<span class="drug">Lorazepam</span>**
  -   O –** <span class="drug">Oxazepam</span>**
  -   T – **<span class="drug">Temazepam</span>**

- The ‘LOT’ drugs do not have active metabolites after hepatic conjugation, and therefore have minimally affected half-lives in patients with liver disease. 

These do not have active metabolites, and the half-life remains relatively the same even in the setting of liver disease.

The rest of the benzodiazepines are primarily metabolized via hepatic CYP-mediated oxidation. 

- These may have prolonged duration of effect in patients with marked liver impairment.
- Examples: Drugs with active metabolites include - 

  - **<span class="drug">Diazepam</span>**
  - **<span class="drug">Clonazepam</span>**
  - **<span class="drug">Midazolam</span>**. 
  
Some practitioners like to take advantage of the longer duration of action and active metabolites
