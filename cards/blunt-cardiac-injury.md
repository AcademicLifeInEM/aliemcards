# Blunt Cardiac Injury

*Definition:* Encompasses wide spectrum of clinical injuries, ranging from asymptomatic myocardial bruise to cardiac rupture/death 
**No gold standard** 
**Pearls:**

-   Causes 20% of all deaths due to motor vehicle collisions
-   Most commonly injured chamber = right ventricle (most anterior in chest) 

**Clinical tips:**

-   Suspect in anyone with significant blunt, deceleration, or crush trauma to chest
-   Consider BCI in hemodynamically unstable patients without alternative cause
-   Troponin I and T lack adequate sensitivity as screening test
