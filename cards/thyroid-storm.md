# Thyroid Storm: Treatment Strategies

**Take Home Points**

-   Endocrinologic emergencies are too easily labeled as “sepsis”, as they can present very similarly. 
-   A [scoring system](http://www.medicalcriteria.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=262%3Aendts&catid=52%3Aendocrinology-and-metabolism&Itemid=80&lang=en) developed by Burch and Wartofsky can assist in determining the likelihood of thyroid storm in patients based on presenting signs and symptoms. 
-   A previous [ALiEM blog post](http://academiclifeinem.com/diagnosing-hyperthyroidism/) further discusses some of the nuances associated with the diagnosis of thyroid storm.

**You can think of the mainstay treatment strategies of thyroid storm based on three main goals:**

1.  Block the production and release of thyroid hormone 
2.  Block the sympathetic outflow 
3.  Block peripheral conversion of T4 to T3

##  THIONAMIDES

-   Mechanism of action: Inhibit thyroid peroxidase, an enzyme involved in the production of T3 and T4 through the iodination of tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin
-   Agents: <span class="drug">propylthiouriacil</span> (PTU) and <span class="drug">methimazole</span> (MMI)
-   Dosing
    -   **PTU**
        -   Loading dose: 600 to 1000 mg PO
        -   Maintenance dose: 200 to 250 mg PO q4h
    -   **MMI**
        -   Loading dose: 20 to 25 mg
        -   Maintenance dose: 20 to 25 mg PO q4h

<!-- -->

-   No head-to-head trials have shown any benefit of using one thionamide over another in the management of thyroid storm
-   Additional benefit of <span class="drug">PTU</span> in thyroid storm:
    -   Inhibition of the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 (3rd “B”)
-   Alternative routes of administration:
    -   <span class="drug">PTU</span> and <span class="drug">MMI</span> can both be administered through the rectal route as a suppository and retention enema
        -   Shown to have good response in several trials \[[Bartle (1988)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3410604), [Alfadhi (2011)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21254909)\]
    -   Intravenous (IV) thionamides are currently not commercially available in the United States
        -   IV formulation of MMI is available in Europe
        -   Success reported in case reports and case series of treating thyroid storm with IV MMI compounded formulations \[[Sowinski (1988)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3224594), [Hodak (2006)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16889494), [Solomon (1993)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8435884)\]
-   Pregnancy considerations:
    -   <span class="drug">PTU</span> is generally preferred over <span class="drug">MMI</span>
-   Adverse effects:
    -   <span class="drug">PTU</span>: black box warning for severe and/or life-threatening hepatotoxicity issued by FDA in 2010
    -   Agranulocytosis:
        -   Can occur at any point during treatment
        -   Tends to be dose-related with MMI, unlike PTU
        -   Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) can be used in the management of thionamide-induced agranulocytosis

## INORGANIC IODINE

-   Used to prevent the release of pre-formed thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland
-   Various formulations:
    -   **Saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI)**: 5 drops PO, NG, or PR q6h
    -   **Lugol’s solution:** 8 drops PO, NG, or PR q6h
    -   **Sodium iodide:** 500 mg IV q12h 
-   Administration of inorganic iodine should be delayed for at least one hour after initiation of thionamide therapy
-   <span class="drug">Iodine</span> load can serve as a substrate for thyroid hormone synthesis and exacerbate thyroid storm
-   <span class="drug">Iodine</span> content of formations (NOTE: Solutions **are not interchangeable**.)

| Iodine Solution  | Content of Iodine Per Drop |
|------------------|--------|
| SSKI             | 38 mg iodine  |
| Lugol's Solution | 8 mg iodine  |

-   The dose is by the **dropperful** (as opposed to mL) of solution
-   Dissolve the dose in solution of 3 to 4 ounces of milk, fruit juice, or water to ensure that the full dose is given and to mask the bitter taste
-   If true allergy to iodine or contraindication to iodine therapy (e.g. <span class="drug">amiodarone</span>-induced thyrotoxicosis):
    -   Consider administration of <span class="drug">lithium</span> carbonate 300 mg PO or NG q6h
    -   Maintain <span class="drug">lithium</span> level within range of 0.8 to 1.2 mEq/L

## BETA BLOCKADE

-   Enhanced α- and β-adrenergic stimulation in the setting of thyroid storm leads to clinical manifestations
-   **<span class="drug">Propranolol</span>:** most commonly used agent
    -   Inhibits peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 (3nd “B”)
        -   Effect not demonstrated considerably with other β-antagonists
    -   Blocks non-selective β-adrenergic receptors to allow for effective treatment of systemic effects, such as tremor, tachycardia, agitation, fever, diaphoresis, psychosis (2nd “B”)
    -   Dose: 60 to 80 mg PO q4h
        -   Proper dosing of <span class="drug">propranolol</span> is essential because of dose-dependent effects on inhibition of peripheral conversion of thyroid hormone (&gt; 160 mg/day), and rapid metabolism of the agent in the setting of thyroid storm
    -   Alternative route of <span class="drug">propranolol</span>: IV formulation (determine availability at your institution)
    -   Two-step method for administration:

    1.  Test dose: 0.5 to 1 mg as slow IV push administered over 10 minutes
    2.   Subsequent doses: 1 to 3 mg IV over 10 to 15 minutes every few hours to desired effect with monitoring of cardiac rhythm
-   **<span class="drug">Esmolol</span>** can be considered as an alternative agent
-   Contraindications to beta blockade: guanethidine or reserpine with close monitoring for hypotension

## CORTICOSTEROIDS

-   Depression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis commonly occurs in the setting of thyroid storm
-   Additional benefit: inhibition of peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 (3rd “B”)
-   **<span class="drug">Hydrocortisone</span>**: loading dose of 300 mg IV followed by maintenance dose of 100 mg IV q8h (or dose equivalent)

## OTHER THERAPIES

-   **<span class="drug">Cholestyramine</span> resin:**
    -   Can be used to interrupt enterohepatic recirculation of thyroid hormone, leading to decreased circulating levels of thyroid hormone \[[Nabil (1982)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7054215), [Mercado (1996)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8784067)\]
    -   Dose: 4 g PO q6h
-   **Supportive measures**
    -   Fluid resuscitation
    -   Dissipation of heat with various cooling modalities for hyperthermia control
    -   Benzodiazepines for control of agitation and to minimize sympathetic outflow
