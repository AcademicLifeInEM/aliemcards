# Pediatric Fever Without a Source: 29 Days - 3 Months

Age: 29 days to 3 months old

Fever defined as temperature **&ge; 38°C / 100.4 °F** (rectal)

Viral URI symptoms do NOT count as a fever source in this age group. 

- While RSV+ infants have a decreased serious bacterial infection risk, rate of concurrent UTI = 5.5%.

## Background

History and physical are not reliable to rule-out serious bacterial infection

Serious bacterial infections include:

- Urinary tract infection (up to 15%)
- Bacteremia (1%)
- Meningitis (0.2-0.4%)
- Others:
- Gastroenteritis
- Osteomyelitis
- Pneumonia
- Septic joint
- Soft tissue infection

**Pathogens:** 

- More common:
- E. coli
- Group B Strep
- S. pneumo
- Less common:
  - N meningitides
  - H flu (type B)
  - Staph aureus

Pyelonephritis: Diagnosis made if positive for LE or nitrites, or >10 WBC/hpf

**Caution:** Serum WBC does NOT predict meningitis ([Bonsu, Annals EM, 2003](http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(02)84932-0/abstract))

## "Low risk infant" Criteria and Workup

Rochester and Philadelphia apply only to the age group of 29-60 days. Boston applies to the age group of 29-90 days.

### Rochester Criteria

History

- Term infant
- No perinatal abx
- No underlying dz
- Not hospitalized longer than mother

Physical

- Well-appearing
- No ear, soft tissue, or bone infection

Labs

- WBC 5K-15K
- Absolute band count &lt;1.5K
- Urine &le;10 WBC/hpf
- Stool &le;5 WBC/hpf

### Philadelphia Criteria

History

- Immunocompetent

Physical

- Well-appearing
- Unremarkable exam

Labs

- WBC &lt;15K
- Band-neutrophil ratio &lt;0.2
- Urine &lt;10 WBC/hpf
- Urine gram stain negative
- CSF &lt;8 WBC
- CSF gram stain negative
- Stool (if diarrhea): No blood, few or no WBC on smear

CXR: no infiltrate

### Boston Criteria

History

- No immunizations within last 48 hr
- No antibiotics within last 48 hr
- Not dehydrated

Physical

- Well-appearing
- No ear, soft tissue, or bone infection

Labs

- WBC &lt;20K
- Urine &lt;10 WBC/hpf
- CSF &lt;10 WBC/hpf
- CXR: no infiltrate

All recommend minimum workup: **CBC**, **catheterized UA** and **urine culture**. 

Further workup by criteria:

| **Criteria ** |      **Blood cx**     |      **CXR**      |         **LP**        | **Abx** |
| ------------- | :-------------------: | :---------------: | :-------------------: | :-----: |
| Rochester     | If abnormal serum WBC | If respiratory sx | If abnormal serum WBC |    No   |
| Philadelphia  |        Required       |      Required     |        Required       |    No   |
| Boston        |        Required       | If respiratory sx |        Required       |   Yes   |

## SUGGESTED WORKUP varies by provider and local practices

Generally accepted workup includes:

1. CBC with differential
2. Blood cultures
3. Catheterized urinalysis and urine culture (or via suprapubic tap)
4. Consider: CSF studies, if ill-appearing infant

- NOTE: Strongly consider if giving antibiotics (cell count, glucose, protein, gram stain, culture, extra tube to hold for potential other studies)

5. _Consider:_ Stool culture (if diarrhea)
6. _Consider:_ CXR and rapid viral testing (if respiratory sx or increased work of breathing)

## Treatment

**Low risk infant:** Must have a reliable caregiver who can return in 24 hours

- Options for management:

  - No antibiotics and close follow-up in 24 hrs
  - <span class="drug">Ceftriaxone</span> IV/IM after LP with close follow-up in 24 hrs

**High risk infant:** Admit to hospital for **<span class="drug">ceftriaxone</span> IV/IM** and closer observation
