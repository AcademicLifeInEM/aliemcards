# Head CT: When unnecessary before LP for meningitis

**Caveat**: This review only applies to those patients in whom you suspect meningitis. This does not apply to those being worked up for subarachnoid hemorrhage.

If **ZERO** high risk features, it is safe to do LP without a Head CT:

| **High risk features associated with abnormal CT:**        |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Age ≥ 60 yr                                                |
| Immunocompromise (HIV, transplant, immunosuppression)      |
| History of CNS disease (mass lesion, CVA, focal infection) |
| Seizure &lt; 1 wk prior to arrival                         |
| Altered level of consciousness                             |
| Unable to answer 2 questions correctly                     |
| Unable to follow 2 commands correctly                      |
| Gaze palsy                                                 |
| Abnormal visual fields                                     |
| Facial palsy                                               |
| Arm or leg drift                                           |
| Abnormal language / speech                                 |

**Study specifics by Hasbun et al.**

**([Hasbun et al. NEMJ, 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11742046))**

**Design: **Prospective observational single-site study (n = 301)

**Observed results**: 

-   Got a CT (235/301) --&gt; 56/235 (24%) had abnormal CT --&gt; 11/56 had mass effect

**Validation arm: Applying the “high risk” criteria back to the enrollment group:**

Got a CT (235/301) --&gt; 96/235 (41%) had no “high risk” features --&gt; 93/96 (97%) had normal CT --&gt; 3/96 (3%) had 2 non-herniations and 1 mild herniation on CT--&gt; All 3 patients got LP without complications.

**Results tracking saved time:**

-   Time to antibiotics (3.8 hr for CT+ vs 2.9 hr for CT-) 
-   Time to LP (5.3 hr for CT+ vs 3.0 hr for CT-)

**Limitations**

-   Study requires validation on separate population (different from derivation group) 

**Conclusion**

-   If no abnormal “high risk” clinical features, you can do LP without a CT for meningitis (NPV = 97%) 
-   Skipping the head CT prior to LP decreases time-to-antibiotics and time-to-LP
