# Fractures, C1 and C2 Spine

## Atlanto-occipital dislocation

| Mechanism   | Stable      |
|-------------|-------------|
| Flexion     | No          |

- Often instantly fatal
- More common in children because small horizontally-oriented occipital condyles
- Dislocation can be anterior (most common), superiorly distracted, or posterior

## Anterior atlantoaxial dislocation

| Mechanism   | Stable      |
|-------------|-------------|
| Flexion     | No          |

- Associated with transverse ligament rupture
- Most commonly occurs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis from ligament laxity
- Widening of predental space seen on lateral plain film

## Jefferson fracture = C1 burst fracture

| Mechanism   | Stable      |
|-------------|-------------|
| Axial Compression  | No          |

- 33% with associated C2 fracture
- Low incidence of neurologic injury because of wide C1 spinal canal
- Usually involves fractures of both the anterior and posterior C1 arches, often with 3 or 4 fracture fragments
- Complication: transverse ligament rupture, especially if C1 lateral masses are&nbsp;â‰¥7 mm wider than expected (MRI recommended)
- Complication: vertebral artery injury (CT angiography recommended)

## C1 posterior arch fracture

| Mechanism   | Stable      |
|-------------|-------------|
| Extension   | Yes         |

- An associated C2 fracture (occurs 50% of time) makes the posterior arch fracture unstable
- On plain films, no displacement of lateral masses on the odontoid view and no prevertebral soft tissue swelling, unlike Jefferson burst fracture

## C2 dens fracture

| Mechanism   | Stable      |
|-------------|-------------|
| Flexion     | +/-         |

- *Type I* (stable): Avulsion of dens with intact transverse ligament
- *Type II* (unstable): Fracture at base of dens; 10% have an associated rupture of the transverse ligament-- MRI provides definitive diagnosis of ligament rupture
- *Type III* (stable): Fracture of dens extending into vertebral body

## Hangman's fracture = C2 spondylolisthesis

| Mechanism   | Stable      |
|-------------|-------------|
| Extension   | No          |

- Bilateral C2 pedicle fractures
- At risk for disruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL), C2 anterior subuxation, and C2-C3 disk rupture
- Low risk for spinal cord injury because of C2 anterior subluxation, which widens spinal canal

## Extension teardrop fracture

| Mechanism   | Stable      |
|-------------|-------------|
| Extension   | No          |

- Small triangular avulsion of anteroinferior vertebral body, at insertion point of anterior longitudinal ligament
O- ccurs most frequently at C2 level, but can occur in lower cervical spine
- Complication: central cord syndrome due to ligamentum flavum buckling during hyperextension
- Requires CT differentiation from very unstable flexion teardrop fracture
