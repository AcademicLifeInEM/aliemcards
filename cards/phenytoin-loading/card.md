# Phenytoin: Rapid Oral Phenytoin Loading in the ED

**Take Home Points**

1.  Oral phenytoin loading can be achieved in a **single dose**, obviating the need for an IV while still achieving quick administration, adequate serum levels, and minimal side effects. 
2.  Both the immediate release (suspension or chewable tablet) and extended release (<span class="drug">phenytoin</span> sodium ER capsule) products have been used successfully.
3.  IV loading does achieve quicker therapeutic level (3 hours), so there may still be a risk of seizure for a short time after oral loading.

Drug references say that an oral loading dose (15-20 mg/kg) of <span class="drug">phenytoin</span> should be administered in 3 divided doses given every 2 hours to decrease GI adverse effects and to ensure complete oral absorption. For a 1 gm dose, that would be 400 mg, then 300 mg, then 300 mg administered every 2 hours. However, this would take 4+ hour total administration time. Therefore, consider giving the oral phenytoin load as a single dose. 
We frequently give 500 mg now and 500 mg more in two hours at discharge.

## Supporting data for single dose

[Osborn, 1987](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3826809): 
-   A single 18 mg/kg dose of oral <span class="drug">phenytoin</span> capsules or suspension (mean dose, 1.3 g) was given to 44 patients with recent seizures and no detectable serum <span class="drug">phenytoin</span> level. 
-   Mean serum <span class="drug">phenytoin</span> levels after loading for patients receiving capsules were 6.8 mcg/mL at 2 hours, 9.7 mcg/mL at 3-5 hours, 12.3 mcg/mL at 6-10 hours, and 15.1 mcg/mL at 16-24 hours.

[Evens, 1980](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7361796):
-   A single 900 mg dose of oral <span class="drug">phenytoin</span> sodium was given to 6 healthy men. Total (bound and free) plasma <span class="drug">phenytoin</span> levels were within the therapeutic range (10-20 mcg/mL) for two subjects and close (not less than 8.39 mcg/mL) for the remaining four. 
-   Peak free drug levels were 1.01-1.60 mcg/mL. 
-   Time to reach total and free peak plasma levels was 6-14 hours and 2-10 hours, respectively.

[Ratanakorn, 1997](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9094065):
-   A single oral <span class="drug">phenytoin</span> dose of 18.7 mg/kg in males and 24.8 mg/kg in females rapidly produced therapeutic concentration (10 mcg/mL) within an average of 2 hours in males and 2.4 hours in females with minimal side-effects.
