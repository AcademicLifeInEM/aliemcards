# Ketofol for Procedural Sedation

**Take Home Points**

-   <span class="drug">Ketofol</span> is a combination of <span class="drug">ketamine</span> and <span class="drug">propofol</span>: <span class="drug">ketamine</span> gives you a dissociative sedative, analgesic, and amnestic effect, while <span class="drug">propofol</span> gives you rapid sedation and antiemetic effects. 
-   Overall, it appears that <span class="drug">ketofol</span> could have a slightly better time to sedation, and length of sedation, but this is not statistically significant based on available evidence. However, it does appear that <span class="drug">ketofol</span> does have a more steady sedation depth not requiring as many subsequent doses.  
-   More studies needed (it would be great to see a three-armed study comparing <span class="drug">ketofol</span>, <span class="drug">ketamine</span>, and <span class="drug">propofol</span> with appropriate and clinically equivalent dosing for each).

## KETAMINE BASICS

![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/2/5/b646845a-82b5-58eb-b4a2-8ac3f55271f7/640.png)

<span class="drug">Ketamine</span> is a dissociative anesthetic that is a phencyclidine derivative and provides sedation, analgesia, and amnesia. It works by inhibiting catecholamine uptake, which exerts a sympathomimetic effect.

**Typical dose:** 1–2 mg/kg IV or 4–5 mg/kg IM.
-   **Additional doses:** may be required at increments of 0.5-1 mg/kg. 

**Major adverse outcomes:** airway obstruction, hypoxia, apnea, and laryngospasm. 
-   In a meta-analysis, of 8,282 patients, [Green et al (2009)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19201064) stated that the total incidence of these major adverse outcomes was only 3.9%. 
-   Vomiting occurs in about 7 – 26% of patients.

***What about the elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) that we are always hearing about?***

[Drayna et al (2011)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22169582) found minimal, transient elevations of IOP that were not clinically meaningful. 
-   The largest difference from baseline IOP occurred at 15 minutes with an estimated change of only 1.09 mmHg.

## PROPOFOL BASICS

![](https://d2p53dh3qxfm0x.cloudfront.net/uploads/img/1jy/2/5/23be4f75-bdb1-5c43-91db-0339460f32d4/640.png)

<span class="drug">Propofol</span> is a lipophilic, ultra short-acting hypnotic agent, which works by potentiating GABA receptors on the neuronal lipid membranes. It does not provide any analgesia, and therefore should not be used as a sole agent for sedation. Note that one of its advantages is its anti-emetic property with a very low incidence of vomiting.

**Typical dosing:** 1-2 mg/kg bolus followed by either a continuous infusion at 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/min or by 0.5 mg/kg boluses every 2 – 3 minutes. 
The [Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium looked at 49,836 propofol sedation cases](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19201064) and found no instances of death associated with propofol. 
-   CPR was required in 2 cases, aspiration occurred in 4 cases, oxygen desaturation (less than 90% for longer than 30 sec duration) occurred in 716 cases, and central apnea occurred in 143 cases. 

## HOW DO YOU MIX KETOFOL?

No standard dosing regimen established.

Most studies and authors recommend a **1:1 ratio** to provide ease of administration. The medications can be mixed or given sequentially. 

**[PEM ED Podcast by Andrew Sloas](http://www.pemed.org/blog/2012/6/1/sedation-and-ketofol.html) on ketofol dosing**

-   **Summary:** <span class="drug">Ketamine</span> comes in a 50 mg/mL concentration, so if you take a 10 mL saline flush and empty 2 mL and draw up 2 mL of <span class="drug">ketamine</span> you have 100 mg of <span class="drug">ketamine</span>. <span class="drug">Propofol</span> comes in a standard 10 mg/mL concentration. So if you fill a 10 mL syringe with this you have 100 mg of propofol. If you mix the two in a new 20 or 30 mL syringe you get 100 mg <span class="drug">ketamine</span> + 100 mg <span class="drug">propofol</span> = 200 mg total. Now every one mL has 10 mg of <span class="drug">ketofol</span>. Your starting dose of this will be 0.5 mg/kg followed by another 0.5 mg/kg after about 30-60 sec. From then on for maintenance you can use 0.25 mg/kg as needed.

## WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE FOR KETOFOL?

**ROUND 1: KETAMINE VS KETOFOL**

[Shah et al (2010)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20947210) conducted a blinded, randomized trial of 136 pediatric patients (ages 2 – 17 years) that required orthopedic procedures and randomized them to <span class="drug">ketofol</span> 1 mg/kg versus <span class="drug">ketamine</span> 1 mg/kg.

**Results:**

-   Median dose of <span class="drug">ketamine</span> = 1 mg/kg (ketamine group) vs 0.5 mg/kg (<span class="drug">ketofol</span> group) 
-   Median total sedation time = 16 min (<span class="drug">ketamine</span>) vs 13 min (<span class="drug">ketofol</span>). This was not statistically significant. 
-   Median recovery time = 12 min (<span class="drug">ketamine</span>) vs 10 min (<span class="drug">ketofol</span>). This was also not statistically significant. 
-   Number of adverse events = 36% (<span class="drug">ketamine</span>) vs 21% (<span class="drug">ketofol</span>). Much more vomiting in the <span class="drug">ketamine</span> group (12%) compared to <span class="drug">ketofol</span> group (2%). 
-   No patients required BVM ventilation or intubation. 
-   Satisfaction scores: Significantly higher in the <span class="drug">ketofol</span> versus the ketamine group for patients/parents, nurses, and physicians. 
-   Recovery times were not statistically different between both groups, which was thought to be because ketamine 1 mg/kg may have been underdosed. This contrasts prior studies documenting a recovery time of 25-108 min (ketamine) versus 14-15 min (<span class="drug">ketofol</span>)

**Conclusion:**<span class="drug">Ketofol</span> has slightly better median total sedation time and recovery time (although not statistically significant) with far fewer adverse reactions, specifically vomiting. Physician, nursing, and patient/parent satisfaction scores were significantly better with <span class="drug">ketofol</span>.

**ROUND 2: PROPOFOL VS KETOFOL**

[Andolfatto et al (2012)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22401952) performed a blinded randomized trial of 284 patients over the age of 14 in an ED setting comparing <span class="drug">propofol</span> 0.75 mg/kg versus <span class="drug">ketofol</span> 0.75 mg/kg.

**Results:**

-   Adverse respiratory event (primary outcome) = 32% (<span class="drug">propofol</span>) vs 30% (<span class="drug">ketofol</span>) 
-   Subsequent dosing needed in 65% (<span class="drug">propofol</span>) vs 46% (<span class="drug">ketofol</span>) of patients 
-   Both groups had similar satisfaction scores. 

**Important points:**

-   The <span class="drug">propofol</span> bolus dose of 0.75 mg/kg was significantly lower than the more universally used 1 mg/kg dose. This may be why the number of patients having respiratory events was so close to the <span class="drug">ketofol</span> group. 
-   The dosing of <span class="drug">propofol</span> was q1 minute, despite the more traditional interval of q3 minutes. This increased dosing frequency may have contributed to the higher incidence of hypoxia and BVM ventilation (25%) than in the literature (8-14%). 

**Conclusion:**<span class="drug">Ketofol</span> did not result in a reduced incidence of adverse respiratory events compared to <span class="drug">propofol</span>. There was also no difference in induction time, efficacy, and sedation time. Sedation depth appeared to be better in the <span class="drug">ketofol</span> group.
