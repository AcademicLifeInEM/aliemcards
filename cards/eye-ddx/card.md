# Background

The rule of 2s, as illustrated below, is a simple method with an anatomical approach to the major ocular diagnoses and is meant to provide a general framework to guide the physical exam and include or eliminate certain conditions. The rule of 2s is easy to remember as it contains the number 2 in the context of eyes and proceeds from layer to layer of the eye in an anterior to posterior direction highlighting the 2 major associated diagnoses of that layer.  


## Anterior Eye – Utilize slit lamp exam
![anterior eye picture - conjunctiva (conjunctivitis and subconjunctival hemorrhage), cornea (corneal abrasion, corneal ulcer/infiltrate/keratitis, anterior chamber (cell/flare (uveitis, iritis), fluid (hyphema (blood), hypopyon (pus))), lens (cataract or swelling (as in hyperglycemia), dislocation)](image-1.png)

## Posterior Eye – Use fundoscopy and ultrasound
![posterior eye picture - vitreous (vitreous hemorrhage, posterior vitreous detachment), retina (retinal detachment, retinal vascular occlusion (central retinal artery or vein occlusion), optic nerve (optic neuritis (inflammation), temporal arteritis (ischemia)](image-2.png)

## Other Eye Diagnoses
![other eye diagnoses - trauma (globe rupture, retrobulbar hemorrhage), 2 Not to miss Bs (foreign body, blowout fracture), chemical injury (acid, alkali), increased pressure (papilledema or glaucoma), infections that manifest in the outer eye (dacrocystitis, periorbital/orbital cellulitis)](image-3.png)
