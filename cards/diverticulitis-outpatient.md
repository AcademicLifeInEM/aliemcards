# Diverticulitis Outpatient Treatment

The **classic teaching** for the treatment ofdiverticulitis has included:

-   Hospital admission
-   Bowel rest (NPO)
-   IV fluids
-   Broad spectrum IV antibiotics

Early literature suggests that there is a small sub-population who fare well with outpatient treatment. ([Friend et al., Ann Emerg Med, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21770056))

## Outpatient treatment

**BOTTOM LINE:** Uncomplicated diverticulitis might be treated as outpatient if:

-   Can tolerate POs
-   No significant comorbidities
-   Able to obtain antibiotics
-   Have adequate pain control
-   Access to followup and social support 

[Mizuki study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=￼￼15801924):
-   Prospective observational study of outpatient abx treatment for diverticulitis in Japan 
-   *Diverticulitis diagnosis*: Based on exam, blood tests, and ultrasound (no CT) 
-   *Inclusion criteria*: Age &lt; 80 years, diverticulitis
-   *Exclusion criteria*: “Severe” diverticulitis on ultrasound, uncontrolled DM, heart failure, renal dz, end-stage cancer, antibiotics within past 24 hrs. 
-   *Study group*: n=70 during 1997-2002 period
-   *Method*: Day 4 and Day 7 followup
-   *Result*: 68 of 70 (97%) were successfully treated as outpatient 

[Ridgway study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=￼19016815):

-   Randomized controlled trial of IV vs PO antibiotics (cipro/metronidazole combo) fordiverticulitis in Ireland. All patients admitted to hospital.
-   *Diverticulitis diagnosis*: Purely based on clinical exam (no imaging test).
-   *Inclusion criteria*: Left iliac fossa pain and LLQ abdominal tenderness
-   *Exclusion criteria:* Generalized abdominal tenderness or evidence of perforation 
-   *Study group*: n=79 (41 with PO abx, 38 with IV abx)
-   *Result*: No difference in tenderness and days-to-resolution between groups. 

[Alonso study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=￼￼19906059):
-   Cohort study with outpatient treatment using PO antibiotics (amox/clavulanic +metronidazole combo). All patients admitted to hospital.
-   *Inclusion criteria*: Diverticulitis diagnosis by clinical exam, labs, and CT imaging 
-   *Exclusion criteria*: Unable to tolerate POs, comorbidities (DM, renal insufficiency,heart failure, COPD, no family support)
-   *Study group*: n=70
-   *Methods*: Follow-up 4-7 days after initial ED visit.
-   *Result*: 68 (97%) were successfully treated as outpatient. 2 (3%) failed outpatient tx because for increased abdominal pain (1) and vomiting (1). 

[Etzioni study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=￼￼19906059):

Retrospective study of outpatient diverticulitis patients
*Diverticulitis diagnosis:* By clinical exam, labs, and CT
*Inclusion criteria*: Outpatient diverticulitis patients
*Exclusion criteria*: Prior dx of diverticulitis, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel dzStudy group: n=693 outpatient diverticulitis patients
*Result*: 554 (94%) were successfully treated as outpatient.
*Predictors of treatment failure*:
-   Female: OR = 3.08 \[1.31-7.28\]
-   Free fluid on CT: OR = 3.19 \[1.45-7.05\]
-   WBC, perforation, abscess, phlegmon were not predictive (OR crossed 1.0)

**Word of caution:** This only provides guidelines, based on the limited evidence out there. Stilluse your **common sense**. Still consider admitting patients who are elderly(&gt;80 years old) or have evidence of any perforation on CT. If on the fence,admit the patient.
