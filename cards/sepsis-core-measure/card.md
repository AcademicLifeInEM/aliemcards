# Sepsis Core Measure

In 2015 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) adopted the Sepsis Bundle Project, which is a quality improvement projected aimed at improving sepsis mortality by improving compliance with national guidelines. But the CMS definitions of sepsis, differ from those is prominent trials (PROCESS, ARISE, PROMISE), and have since diverged from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign definitions, which may be different from your hospital guidelines! This card will help you keep it all straight.

## CMS Definitions

### Sepsis
Two SIRS criteria _plus_ suspected infection

### Severe Sepsis
Sepsis _plus_ one or more signs of organ dysfunction

### Septic Shock
Severe sepsis _plus_ sepsis-induced hypoperfusion persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation _or_ lactate > 4 mmol/L

| SIRS Criteria                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| Temp >38°C (100.4°F) or < 36°C (96.8°F)       |
| Heart rate > 90                               |
| Respiratory rate > 20 or PaCO₂ < 32 mm Hg     |
| WBC > 12,000/mm³, < 4,000/mm³, or > 10% bands |

| Organ Dysfunction Criteria                                                |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SBP < 90, or MAP < 65, or SBP decrease of > 40 mmHg from known baseline   |
| Creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL, or urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 2 hours      |
| Bilirubin > 2 mg/dL (34.2 mmol/L)                                         |
| Platelet count < 100,000                                                  |
| INR > 1.5 or aPTT > 60 sec                                                |
| Lactate > 2 mmol/L (18.0 mg/dL)                                           |

| Sepsis-induced Hypoperfusion                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SBP < 90, or MAP < 70, or SBP decrease of > 40 mmHg or > 2 standard deviations from normal for age or known baseline |

_SBP_ - systolic blood pressure, _MAP_ - mean arterial pressure
