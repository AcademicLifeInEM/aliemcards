# Pediatric Fever Without a Source: 29 Days - 3 Months

Age: 29 days to 3 months old

Fever defined as temperature **≥ 38°C / 100.4 °F** (rectal)

Viral URI symptoms do NOT count as a fever source in this age group. 

-   While RSV+ infants have a decreased serious bacterial infection risk, rate of concurrent UTI = 5.5%.

## Background

History and physical are not reliable to rule-out serious bacterial infection

Serious bacterial infections includes:
-   UTIs - up to 15%
-   Bacteremia 1%
-   Meningitis 0.2-0.4%
-   Others:
  - Gastroenteritis
  - Osteomyelitis
  - Pneumonia
  - Septic joint
  - Soft tissue infection

**Pathogens:** 
-   E. coli
-   Group B Strep
-   S. pneumo
-   N meningitides
-   H flu (type B)
-   Staph aureus

Pyelonephritis: diagnosed if positive for LE or nitrites, or &gt; 10 WBC/hpf

**Caution:** Serum WBC does NOT predict meningitis ([Bonsu, Annals EM, 2003](http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(02)84932-0/abstract))

## "Low risk infant" Criteria and WORKUP

Rochester and Philadelphia apply only to the age group of 29-60 days. Boston applies to the age group of 29-90 days.

**Rochester Criteria**

History
- Term infant
- No perinatal abx
- No underlying dz
- Not hospitalized longer than mother
Physical
- Well-appearing
- No ear, soft tissue, or bone infection
Labs
- WBC 5K-15K
- Absolute band count&nbsp;&lt;1.5K
- Urine ≤10 WBC/hpf&nbsp;
- Stool ≤5 WBC/hpf&nbsp;

**Philadelphia Criteria**

History
- Immunocompetent
Physical
- Well-appearing
- Unremarkable exam
Labs
- WBC &lt; 15K
- Band-neutrophil ratio &lt; 0.2
- Urine &lt;10 WBC/hpf
- Urine gram stain negative
- CSF &lt;8 WBC
- CSF gram stain negative
CXR: no infiltrate
- Stool (if diarrhea):no blood, few&nbsp;or no WBC on smear&nbsp;

**Boston Criteria**

History
- No immunizations within last 48 hr
- No antibiotics within last 48 hr
- Not dehydrated
Physical
- Well-appearing
- No ear, soft tissue, or bone infectionLabs
- WBC &lt; 20K
- Urine &lt;10 WBC/hpf&nbsp;
- CSF &lt;10 WBC/hpf
- CXR: no infiltrate&nbsp;&nbsp;


All recommend minimum workup: **CBC**, **catheterized UA** and **urine culture**. Further workup by criteria:

| **Criteria ** | **Blood cx** | **CXR**    | **LP**      | **Abx** |
|---------------|--------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Rochester     | If abnl WBC  | If resp sx | If abnl WBC | No      |
| Philadelphia  | Required     | Required   | Required    | No      |
| Boston        | Required     | If resp sx | Required    | Yes     |

SUGGESTED WORKUP varies by provider and local practices
CBC with differential
Blood cultures
Catheterized urinalysis and urine culture (or via suprapubic tap)
Consider: CSF studies, if ill-appearing infant
1.  NOTE: Strongly consider if giving antibiotics (cell count, glucose, protein, gram stain, culture, extra tube to hold for potential other studies)

Consider: Stool culture (if diarrhea)
Consider: CXR and rapid viral testing (if respiratory sx or increased work of breathing)

## Treatment

**Low risk infant:** Must have a reliable caregiver who can return in 24 hours

Options:

1.  No antibiotics and close follow-up in 24 hrs
2.  <span class="drug">Ceftriaxone</span> IV/IM after LP with close follow-up in 24 hrs

**High risk infant:** Disposition = admit to hospital for <span class="drug">ceftriaxone</span> IV/IM
