# Ectopic Pregnancy: Making the Diagnosis

Ectopic pregnancy is the leading cause of maternal death in the first trimester of pregnancy. A [recent JAMA systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23613077), from The Rational Clinical Examination series, looked to risk-stratify women in early pregnancy presenting with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding for ectopic pregnancy, identifying the accuracy and precision of elements in the history, physical examination, beta hCG, and ultrasound in ectopic pregnancy. 

The systematic review consisted of 14 studies (n=12,101). The summary prevalence of ectopic pregnancy was 15% (95% CI, 10-22%) in women presenting with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. 

## Background

**Heterotopicpregnancy**: Incidence = 0.3-0.8% (1-3% if assisted reproduction)
**Ectopic pregnancy:** Incidence = as high as 2.6%
-   \#1 cause of 1<sup>st</sup> trimesterpregnancy-related death
-   8-31% initially diagnosed as “pregnancy of unknown location” (PUL), despite beta- HCG and ultrasonography
-   More than half of patients with ectopic pregnancy will have ZERO risk factors

**Discriminatory zone:** Serum beta-HCG level cutoff above which intrauterine pregnancy is likely visible on US.
-   Variable definition of cutoff with range of1,500-3,000 mIU/mL
-   No single serum beta-HCG value is predictive of anectopic pregnancy
-   If beta-HCG above 3,000 mIU/mL and an “emptyuterus” on US, suggestive of ectopic pregnancy

## Diagnostic Tools to Risk Stratify

**Ultrasound:**

-   Findings of an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) such as gestational sac or fetal pole ruled out ectopic pregnancy, except in rare cases of heterotropic prengnacy.
-   Bedside ultrasound is the single most useful diagnostic test. Positive LR = 111. 

**hCG:**
-   The "discriminatory zone" continues to be debated - no consensus on the number
-   A one-time hCG level does not rule out ectopic pregnancy

**CONCLUSIONS: **
1.  **Transvaginal U/S** is the single-best test to assess for ectopic pregnancy
2.  Patient symptoms have limited risk-stratification value
3.  Most predictive physical exam findings for ectopic pregnancy: 

-   Cervical motion tenderness (Positive LR = 4.9)
-   Peritoneal findings (Positive LR = 4.2-4.5)
-   Adnexal mass (Positive LR = 2.4)
