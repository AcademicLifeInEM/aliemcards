# Chemical Sedation: Haldol vs. Ativan vs. Versed

**Question**

What single agent best manages violent, agitated patients in the ED, as measured by shortest time to sedation and shortest time to arousal?

**Methodology**

-   Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study of 111 violent and agitated patients
-   <span class="drug">Haldol<span> (haloperidol 5 mg IM), <span class="drug">Ativan</span> (lorazepam 2 mg IM), or <span class="drug">Versed</span> (midazolam 5 mg IM)
-   <span class="drug">Versed</span> is a water-soluble benzodiazepine – excellent IM absorption profile
-   Patients were agitated because of recreational drug use, alcohol use, and prior psychiatric history and divided equally in each of the 3 arms of treatment.

**Results**

|                        | Haldol (n=42) | Ativan (n=27) | Versed (n=42) |
|------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Time to sedation (min) | 28.3 ± 25     | 32.3 ± 20     | 18.3 ± 14     |
| Time to arousal (min)  | 126.5 ± 85    | 217.2 ± 107   | 81.9 ± 66     |

There were **no significant differences in vital signs** between groups.

Ativan was stopped after the first 95 patients at interim analysis because of prolonged sedation times.

Patients required “rescue drugs”, which were additional sedation medications at the discretion of attending physician: 

-   8 <span class="drug">Haldol</span> patients (19%)
-   7 <span class="drug">Ativan</span> patients (26%) 
-   7 <span class="drug">Versed</span> patients (17%)

**Complications:** 2 patients who received haldol

-   1 had hypotension
-   1 had transient apnea

**BOTTOM LINE:**

-   Use **<span class="drug">versed</span> 5 mg IM** to chemically sedation a severely agitated patients because of its **shorter time to sedation** (18 min) and **arousal** (82 min).

**Other IM options: **

-   *HAC:* <span class="drug">Haldol</span> 5 mg, <span class="drug">Ativan</span> 2 mg, <span class="drug">Cogentin</span> 1 mg IM all in 1 syringe
-   *B52:* <span class="drug">Haldol</span> 5 mg, <span class="drug">Ativan</span> 2 mg, <span class="drug">Benedryl</span> 50 mg IM
