# Influenza: To treat or not to treat?

-   After the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the predominant seasonal influenza A strain is H1N1

## Antiviral Agents

Adamantanes class: **<span class="drug">Amantadine</span>**, **<span class="drug">Rimantidine</span>**
-    Active only against influenza A

Neuroaminidase inhibitors class: **<span class="drug">Oseltamivir</span>** (Tamiflu), **<span class="drug">Zanamivir</span>** (Relenza) 
-   Active against influenza A and B 

## Influenza patients at high risk for complications (e.g. bacterial pneumonia)

-   Age &lt; 5 years old (especially &lt; 2 years)
-   Age ≤ 18 years old on long-term aspirin
-   Age ≥ 65 years old
-   American Indian or Alaska Native ethnicity
-   Comorbidities
  - Chronic pulmonary disease
  - Cardiovascular disease (excluding hypertension)
  - Renal, hepatic, hematologic, metabolic disorders (including DM)
  - Neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions (including seizures)

-   Immunosuppressed (HIV or on immunosuppressive medications)
-   Morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2)
-   Pregnancy or within 2 weeks postpartum
-   Residents of nursing homes or chronic-care facilities 

## CDC Recommendations

1.  Observational study with >700 patients admitted with influenza showed that oseltamivir reduced mortality (hazard ratio=0.27) and earlier hospital discharge (hazard ratio=1.28).
2.  Give antiviral treatment ASAP for outpatients with confirmed or suspected influenza who are at high risk for complications (see list above). Use clinical judgement.
3.  **<span class="drug">Oseltamivir</span>** may be used for treatment or chemoprophylaxis for infants &lt;1 year old.
4.  Consider giving antiviral treatment for confirmed or suspected influenza WITHOUT risk factors for severe illness, if treatment can be started ≤ 48 hours of illness onset. Can reduce duration of uncomplicated influenza A and B illness by 1 day.
5.  Clinicians should monitor local antiviral resistance surveillance data because resistance patterns may change over time.
