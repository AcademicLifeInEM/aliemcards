# Knee Injuries: Knee Dislocation

![](image-1.png)

## X-ray Views

### AP view

Look for avulsion fractures, such as a Segond fracture, which is a lateral tibial condyle avulsion fracture.

### Lateral view

Look for symmetric or irregular joint space.

## Acute Management

**_Orthopedic vascular emergency!_**

Reduce knee and re-examine neurovascular status

Consult vascular surgery for hard signs of vascular injury

Measure Ankle-Brachial index(ABIs):

-   ABI ≥ 0.9: Monitor by serial exam
-   ABI &lt; 0.9: Obtain CT angiography

Splint knee in 20-30 degrees of flexion

## Follow-up Timing

Hospital admission required for serial neurovascular exams and consideration for surgical stabilization.

## Notes

**Dimple sign:** buttonholing of medial femoral condyle through medial capsule.

Suggests irreducible posterolateral dislocation.

Associated findings:

-   Popliteal artery injury (18%)
-   Common peroneal nerveinjury (25%) – check for foot dorsiflexion weakness and numbness to dorsal foot
-   Ligament tears
