# Chest Pain: Risk Stratifying for ACS

U.S. national average for missed cardiac ischemia = 2-4%

***Missed AMI:*** Highest overall cost to insurers of all missed diagnoses in ED

***Dilemma:*** "Low-risk" patients per risk factors and presentation may not be low-risk enough to discharge patient home. In contrast, not ALL low-risk patients need testing and admission.

## Profile of the "missed AMI" patient

- Younger age (&lt; 55 years old)
- Women
- Nonwhite race
- Atypical symptoms
- Most common presenting symptoms: Dyspnea &gt;&gt; diaphoresis, nausea, or syncope
- Most common patient profile for having NO chest pain in ACS presentation: 
  -   Elderly
  -   Female
  -   Hypertension
  -   DM
  -   History of CHF

[Global Registry of Coronary Events](http://www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace/)
- Failure to see signs of ischemia on initial EKG
- Failure to obtain EKG
- Physician inexperience 
- Lower volume EDs

## TIMI Risk Score for UA/Non-STEMI 

| ** Clinical variable**                   |  **Score** |
|------------------------------------------|------------|
| Age &gt; 65 years                        | +1         |
| ≥ 3 CAD risk factors<br />(FHx, HTN, DM, hyperchol, active smoker)                   | +1         |
| Known CAD (stenosis &gt; 50%)            | +1         |
| Aspirin use within last 7 days           | +1         |
| Recent severe angina<br>( ≥ 2 anginal events within 24 hours)                  | +1         |
| Elevated cardiac markers                 | +1         |
| ST segment deviation &gt; 0.5 mm         | +1         |

14-day <span class="aglmd-moreinfo ui-moreinfo" data-iid="53aa2472d35d3ae92e001551">"event rate"</span>:
-   2 points - 8.3%
-   3 points - 13.2%
-   4 points - 19.9%
-   5 points - 26.2%
-   6-7 points - 40.9%

**Beware:** 30-day ischemic complication rate of TIMI score of 0 is still 1.7-2.1%. 

-   Thus low-risk CP pts should have further outpatient diagnostic testing. 
-   TIMI score best for risk stratifying high-risk (not low-risk) pts.

## Normal cardiac cath patient who presents with chest pain

([Burgiardini et al Arch Intern Med, 2006](http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=410613)[)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Burgiardini+Arch+Intern+Med+2006)

-   7,656 patients
-   Looked at patients with normal or mild CAD (&lt;50% stenosis) on cath. 

**Result**: 1-year death or AMI found in 1.2% (normal cath) and 3.3% (mild CAD)
-   Normal cath alone should not completely r/o ACS on representation of CP.
