# Intimate Partner Violence

**Definition:** Physical,sexual, or psychological harm by a current or former partner or spouse. Occurs among heterosexual and same-sex couples.

**Epidemiology:** Lifetime estimates for IPV in women= 22-39%.

**Sequelae:** Untreated IPV results in many physical and psychological morbidities. 

**Pearl:** Physicians should screen, document,intervene, and provide resources.

## Screening

- USPSTF B recommendation for screening women of child-bearing age: high certainty that the net benefit is moderate. Costs and potential harms of screening appear to be outweighed by potential for early intervention with screening.
- Interview patient alone. Frame: “_Because violence is so common, we’re routinely asking our patients about their safety in their relationships_.”
- Increase suspicion of abuse when overly protective partner, history inconsistent with injury, vague complaints, or pregnancy.
