# Suicide: Risk Stratification

## Assessment of suicidal patient

-   Primarily based on clinician judgment while weighing risk and protective factors
-   3 red flags (rational thinking loss, ideation, organized/serious plan)
-   TRAAPPED SILO - "Risk factors" which increase a patient's risk for committing suicide in the near future
-   SAFE - "Protective factors" which decrease a patient's risk for committing suicide in the near future

## Increased Risk


**T**rigger
-   Acute stressor? Loss of job, support, loved one; anniversary of loss; recent psych admission or suicide attempt
-   Teens: disappointment, embarrassment, suicide by peer 

**R**ational thinking loss
*Red flag risk:* Psychosis, agitation, debilitating anxiety 

**A**ge
-   Age doesn’t protect from suicide, but higher risk if age 15-24 and &gt; 65 years
-   3rd cause of death in age 15-24
-   Olderpts use more violent/lethal methods & give less warning

**A**ccess to means
Are there accessible firearms or weapons? In the US, firearms contribute to 60% of all suicide deaths and are the       
most common method across all age groups and gender

**P**revious attempt
38x increased risk for suicide. Higher risk if previous attempt &lt;1 yr ago or more lethal mechanism

**P**revious psychiatric care
Higher risk with higher level of prior psychiatric care (i.e. inpatient)

**E**xcessive EtOH/drugs
50% of deaths involve EtOH intoxication. Increasesimpulsivity. If d/c patient (no longer suicidal when sober),need outpt substance abuse counseling plan

**D**epression/hopeless
-   Major depression increases risk of suicide 20-fold
-   Hopelessness is red flag and indicator of depression severity 

**S**ickness
-   Medical illness may cause functional limitations,depression, or hopelessness
-   High risk dz: Epilepsy, malignancy, CNS disorders (MS) 

**I**deation
-   Red flag risk: Suicidal ideation (SI) is major precursor toattempted/completed suicide BUT SI denial ≠ zero risk
-   Study: 78% psych inpts who committed suicide in hosp orshortly after d/c denied SI in last psych eval

**L**ack of social support
-   Lack of PERCEIVED social support
-   Collaborative history from friends/family helpful

**O**rganized or serious plan
-   Red flag risk: More detailed & lethal the plan --&gt; greater the risk
-   Intent to die is more important than lethality of method. If didn’t attempt, why not? (protective factors) 

## Decreased risk

**S**ocial support
-   Good support with family, friends, church
-    Married with children in home is a protective factor

**A**wareness
Good insight and coping skills 

**F**uture oriented
Thinking about and looking forward to future events

**E**ngaged
-   Engaged in therapeutic process
-   Open to participation inevaluation and therapeutic relationship
-   Does not withhold information
