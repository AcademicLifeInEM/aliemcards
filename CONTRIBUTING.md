# Contributing to ALiEM Cards

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ALiEM Cards. This is a big (and expanding!) project. We couldn't do it without dedicated volunteers who want to make it better.

We have written several short guides to help clarify ALiEM Cards requirements.

1. [Editorial Style Guide](contributing/STYLEGUIDE.md): the basics of what should be included in a card and how it should be written.
2. [Markdown Formatting Guide](contributing/MARKDOWNGUIDE.md): details on how to format your new submission or your edits.
3. [Technical Guide](contributing/TECHNICALGUIDE.md): technical details on how to structure the text and image files that make up an ALiEM Card.

These documents, and additional resources, can be found in the `contributing` folder of this project.
