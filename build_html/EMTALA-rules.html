<h1 id="emtala-transfer-rules">EMTALA Transfer Rules</h1>
<p>The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is a federal law that requires anyone coming to an ED be stabilized and treated, regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay</p>
<ul>
<li>Known as “anti-dumping law”</li>
<li>Goal = ensure “adequate first response to a medical crisis for all patients”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rules-for-the-transferring-ed">Rules for the transferring ED</h2>
<p>Medically screen patients to determine whether a medical emergency exists (regardless of insurance). This goes beyond a triage assessment.
Stabilize patients with medical emergencies to reasonably ensure that no deterioration will result from patient&#39;s transfer.
Restrict transfer of non-stabilized patients to 2 circumstances:</p>
<ol>
<li>Patient requests a transfer in writing after being informed of the risks involved and the hospital’s duty to treat under EMTALA, or</li>
<li>A physician certifies that the medical benefits expected from transfer outweigh the risks involved in the transfer (e.g. need higher level of care)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> When having contractions, an emergency medical condition exists when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inadequate time for safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or</li>
<li>Transfer may pose a threat to the health/safety of patient or unborn child</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="steps-when-transferring-a-patient">Steps when transferring a patient</h2>

<li>Provide signed certificate of transfer</li>
<li>Assure that the transfer takes place with qualified personnel and equipment</li>
<li>Send copies of medical records related to the emergency condition</li>

</ol>
