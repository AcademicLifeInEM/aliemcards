<p><strong>Take Home Points</strong></p>
<p>In Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), we learned that a carotid, femoral, and radial pulse correlates to a certain systolic blood pressure (SBP) in hypotensive trauma patients.  Specifically ATLS stated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carotid pulse only = SBP 60 – 70 mmHg</li>
<li>Carotid &amp; Femoral pulse only = SBP 70 – 80 mmHg</li>
<li>Radial pulse present = SBP &gt;80 mmHg</li>
</ul>
<p>There were two studies [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3337405">Poulton, 1988</a>; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10987771">Deakin, 2000</a>] that evaluated this paradigm.  Although very small studies, they were done by two different authors, using different methods (BP cuff vs arterial line).  Both came to the same conclusion: <strong>ATLS overestimates SBP based on palpation of radial, femoral, &amp; carotid pulses.</strong> Another way to state this is, if using ATLS guidelines to guestimate BP, we are grossly underestimating the degree of hypovolemia our patients have.</p>

<p> [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3337405">Poulton, 1988</a>] &quot;ATLS Paradigm Fails&quot;</p>
<p> <strong>What they did:</strong> Manually measured SBP with sphygmomanometer in 20 hypovolemic trauma patients and compared with ATLS</p>
<ul>
<li>5/20 (25%) pts were correctly predicted by ATLS guidelines</li>
<li>10/20 (50%) pts had false overestimation of BP by ATLS guidelines</li>
<li>False overestimation of BP was greatest in pts with lowest BPs</li>
<li>Mean difference of actual and estimated BP using ATLS was 34 mmHg</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  Radial pulses are often present in severely hypotensive hypovolemic patients, meaning the ATLS paradigm is invalid.</p>

<p>[<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10987771">Deakin, 2000</a>] &quot;Accuracy of ATLS guidelines for predicting SBP&quot;</p>
<p><strong>What they did:</strong> Measured SBP with arterial line in 20 pts with hypovolemic shock and compared to pulses palpated by an observer blinded to BP readings.</p>
<p><strong>What they found: </strong>The disappearance of pulse always occurred in the following order radial &gt; femoral &gt; carotid pulse. There were 4 subgroups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 1: Radial, femoral, and carotid pulses present<ul>
<li>10/12 (83%) had SBP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group 2: Femoral and carotid pulses only<ul>
<li>10/12 (83%) had SBP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group 3: Carotid pulse only<ul>
<li>0/4 (0%) had SBP &gt;60 mmHg</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group 4: Radial, femoral, and carotid pulses absent<ul>
<li>2/3 (67%) had SBP</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> ATLS guidelines for assessing SBP are inaccurate and generally overestimate the patient’s SBP. </p>
