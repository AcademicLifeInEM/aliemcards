<p><strong>Take Home Points</strong></p>
<p>A prospective study needs to be performed to determine the predictive value of elevated troponins in patients with SVT. A more appropriate approach based on the evidence should be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Low risk, prior SVT, feels good after conversion, then NO CARDIAC ENZYMES and outpatient f/u</li>
<li>Intermediate risk, then DO get CARDIAC ENZYMES; If neg, outpatient follow up but if positive consider admission.</li>
<li>High risk, older age, or known history of ACS, then DO CARDIAC ENZYMES and admit.</li>
</ol>
<p>More than one third of patients will have chest pain associated with SVT causing providers to order troponins and other cardiac enzymes. Elevated troponins are not pathognomonic for CAD/ACS and could represent other etiologies such as sepsis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and pulmonary embolism. Also, subsequent coronary angiography is not necessary for risk stratification in all cases. SVT causes a rapid heart rate, which is well documented as a cause for modest troponin elevation secondary to cardiac stretch, poor diastolic perfusion, and/or coronary artery vasospasm.</p>

<ul>
<li>12 – 48% of patients have elevated troponins after SVT [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643248">Bukkapatnam, 2010</a>; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17562784">Dorenkamp, 2007</a>]</li>
<li>Having a known history of CAD is more likely to lead to troponin elevation than not having a history of CAD (62% vs 43%) [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643248">Bukkapatnam, 2010</a>]</li>
<li>There is no difference in the diagnosis of CAD compared to patients with negative troponins  [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643248">Bukkapatnam, 2010</a>]</li>
<li>And if that is not enough, here are 6 studies looking at patients with SVT followed by cardiac angiography.</li>

<strong>Major Limitations:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Few patients (21 patients total)</li>
<li>Average age of patients between 40 – 45 (Younger patient population)</li>
<li>Fewer ACS risk factors in these patients (Less likely to have CAD/ACS)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Elevated troponins in younger patients with minimal risk factors for CAD/ACS in the setting of SVT do <strong>NOT</strong> predict CAD  </p>

<p>[<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20453600">Chow, 2010</a>]</p>
<p>In general, compared to the prior studies, patients in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20453600">this study</a> were older and had more comorbidities. The authors defined clinically significant outcomes as death, MI, or rehospitalization for a cardiac reason during a 1 year follow up after the SVT event. Several conclusions were made which included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patients with more comorbidities (risk factors for ACS) are more likely to have elevated troponins with SVT</li>
<li><p>In comparing elevated versus non-elevated troponin I levels post-SVT, the incidence of adverse outcomes was:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cardiac rehospitalization: 37.9% versus 6.1%</p>
</li>
<li>Myocardial infarction: 6.9% versus 0% (Not Statistically Significant)</li>
<li><p>Death: 20.7% versus 10.2% (Not Statistically Significant)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Major Limitations:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Retrospective Review</li>
<li>70% of patients did not have stress test or angiography for follow up</li>
<li>Unclear if other etiologies such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, or subarachnoid hemorrhage were cause of elevated troponins</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Patients with elevated troponins after SVT have <strong>INCREASED</strong> cardiac rehospitalization over the next year</li>
