    Paucis Verbis Cards
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Paucis Verbis (PV) cards were initially developed as a bedside teaching tool used by Academic Life in Emergency Medicine (ALiEM) Founder and Editor-in-chief Michelle Lin.  They were short, succinct,  rapid-fire summaries of key learning points on various Emergency Medicine (EM) topics that would fit on a 5 x 7 index card. Michelle carried these cards in her pocket and handed them out to trainees as needed. Eventually others at her institution began using the cards and as digital and mobile technology became more ubiquitous, Michelle transitioned the cards to several mobile platforms so that she could share them with the greater EM community.

    This website is the next iteration of that project.
